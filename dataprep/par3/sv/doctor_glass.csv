"Rädda mig, bad hon, rädda mig. – Jag svarade med plikten etc., men det var tydligen något som hon icke förstod. Jag förklarade för henne att lagen icke förstår sig på skämt i sådana fall. – Lagen? Hon såg bara frågande ut. – Jag rådde henne att anförtro sig åt sin mor: så talar hon med pappa, och så blir det bröllop. – O, nej, min fästman har ingenting, och far skulle aldrig förlåta mig. De voro icke förlofvade, hon sade »fästman» blott emedan hon icke kunde finna något annat ord, älskare är ett romanord som låter oanständigt i tal. – Rädda mig, har ni då ingen barmhärtighet!

I explained to her that the law does not understand jokes in such cases. - The law? She just looked questioning. - I advised her to entrust herself to her mother: then she talks to dad, and then there will be a wedding. - Oh, no, my fiancé has nothing, and father would never forgive me. They were not engaged, she said ""fiancé"" only because she could not find another word, lover is a novel word that sounds indecent in speech. - Save me, then you have no mercy! I do not know what I do, I go to Norrström!","“Save me!” she pleaded, “save me!” I responded with duty, etc., but this was apparently beyond her comprehension. I explained to her that the law was no joking matter in cases like this. “The law?” She merely looked puzzled. I advised her to talk to her mother, who would talk to her father, and then there’d be a wedding. “Oh, no, my fiancé has nothing, and Father would never forgive me!” They weren’t engaged; she said “fiancé” for lack of a better word, since “lover” appears only in novels and sounds indecent when spoken aloud. “Save me! Have you no pity? I don’t know what I’ll do—I’ll throw myself into the Stream!”","—Save me, she begged, save me. I replied with duty, etc., but that was clearly something she did not understand. I explained to her how the Law does not connive at any jiggery-pokery in such cases.—A glance of non-comprehension. The Law? I advised her to confide in her mother: She’ll talk to Papa, and there’ll be a wedding.—Oh, no, my fiancé hasn’t a penny, and Father would never forgive me. They weren’t engaged, of course; she used the word ‘fiancé’ because she could find no other, and ‘lover’ is a novelist’s word, foul in the mouth.—Save me! Haven’t you any mercy? I don’t know what I’ll do! I’ll throw myself into the harbour!"

"På kyrkogården promenerar församlingens herde långsamt af och an i den vackra sommarkvällen, stödd på en yngre ämbetsbroders arm. Mitt fönster står öppet, och det är så stilla att ett och annat ord af hvad de säga tränger ända hit upp. De tala om det förestående valet till pastorprimariiämbetet, och jag hörde att kyrkoherden nämnde namnet Gregorius. Han uttalade detta namn utan någon förtjusning och med en icke helt oblandad sympati. Gregorius hör till de präster som alltid ha haft menigheten för sig och som följd däraf ämbetsbröderna emot sig. Jag hörde på tonfallet, att kyrkoherden nämnde hans namn mera i förbigående och att han icke ansåg honom ha några allvarliga utsikter.","In the cemetery, the pastor of the parish walks slowly from time to time in the beautiful summer evening, supported on the arm of a younger brother in office.

He pronounced this name without any delight and with a not entirely unmixed sympathy.

"Drömmar fara som strömmar ... Jag känner dig, gamla ordspråksvisdom. Och det mesta man drömmer är i verkligheten icke värdt en tanke – lösa skärfvor af det man upplefvat, ofta af det likgiltigaste och dummaste, af det som medvetandet inte funnit värdt att taga vara på men som ändå lefver sitt skugglif för sig själf i någon af hjärnans skräpkamrar. Men det fins också andra drömmar. Jag minns en gång hur jag som pojke satt och grubblade en hel eftermiddag öfver ett geometriskt problem och måste gå till sängs utan att ha löst det: i sömnen arbetade hjärnan vidare för sig själf och gaf mig lösningen i drömmen. Och den var riktig. Det finna också drömmar som äro bubblor från djupet. Och när jag rätt tänker efter: – många gånger har en dröm lärt mig något om mig själf. Många gånger har drömmen afslöjat för mig önskningar, som jag icke ville önska, begär, som jag icke ville veta af vid dagsljus. De önskningarna och begären har jag sedan vägt och pröfvat i fullt solsken. Men de tålde sällan ljuset, och merendels stötte jag dem tillbaka ner i de skumma djup dit de hörde. I nattens drömmar kunde de sedan komma igen på nytt, men jag kände igen dem och hånlog åt dem äfven i drömmen, tills de uppgåfvo alla kraf på att stiga upp och lefva i verkligheten och ljuset.","Dreams danger that flows ... I know you, old proverbial wisdom. And most of what one dreams is in reality not worth thinking about - loose fragments of what one has experienced, often of the most indifferent and dumbest, of that which consciousness has not found worth taking care of but which nevertheless lives its shadow life for itself in any of the junk chambers of the brain. But there are also other dreams. I remember once how as a boy I sat and pondered for a whole afternoon over a geometric problem and had to go to bed without having solved it: in sleep the brain continued to work for itself and gave me the solution in the dream. And it was real. There are also dreams that are bubbles from the depths. And when I think about it: - many times a dream has taught me something about myself. Many times the dream has revealed to me desires that I did not want, desires that I did not want to know in broad daylight. I have then weighed and tested those wishes and desires in full sunshine. But they seldom endured the light, and for the most part I pushed them back into the dim depths where they belonged. In the dreams of the night they could then come again, but I recognized them and mocked them even in the dream, until they gave up all power to get up and live in reality and light.","“Dreams flow like streams . . .” I remember the old saying. And it’s true, most of what we dream is actually not worth a second thought—loose fragments of our experiences, often the most indifferent and silly ones, that our conscious minds haven’t bothered to preserve but which still lead a shadow life of their own off in some junk room of the brain. But there are other dreams, too. I remember how once, as a boy, I sat for an entire afternoon puzzling over a geometry problem and had to go to bed without solving it. While I was asleep my brain kept working on its own and gave me the answer in a dream. And it was correct. There are also dreams that are bubbles from the deep. And when I think it over, many times a dream has taught me something about myself. Many times a dream has revealed wishes I didn’t want to acknowledge, desires I wanted to deny in the daylight. Those wishes and desires I’ve later weighed and tested in full sun. But they could seldom stand the light, and usually I forced them back into the dim recesses where they belonged. In my nocturnal dreams they might return, but I recognized them and smiled scornfully at them even in the dream until they gave up all claim of emerging and living in the light of reality.","‘Dreams run like streams.’ … Hoary proverbial wisdom, I know you well. And in reality most of what one dreams is not worth a second thought—loose fragments of experience, often the silliest and most indifferent, fragments of those things consciousness has judged unworthy of preservation but which, even so, go on living a shadow life of their own in the attics and box-rooms of the mind. But there are other dreams. As a lad I remember sitting a whole afternoon pondering on a geometrical problem, and in the end having to go to bed with it still unsolved: asleep, my brain went on working of its own accord and a dream gave me the solution. And it was correct. Dreams there are, too, like bubbles from the depths. And now I come to think of it more clearly —many a time has a dream taught me something about myself, often revealed to me wishes I did not wish to wish, desires of which I did not wish to take daylight cognizance. These wishes, these dreams, I’ve afterwards weighed and tested in bright sunshine. But rarely have they stood up to the daylight, and more often than not I’ve flung them back into the foul depths where they belong. In the night they might assail me anew, but I recognised them and, even in dreams, laughed them to scorn, until they relinquished all claim to arise and live in reality and the light of day."

"Men under hela den tiden låg mitt driftlif i en halfslummer, lefvande nog att väcka obestämda drömmar och begär, som hos en ung flicka, men icke mäktigt och bjudande som hos andra unga män. Och om jag också emellanåt vakade en natt igenom i heta fantasier, föreföll det mig dock alltid otänkbart att jag skulle kunna finna tillfredsställelse hos de kvinnor som mina kamrater besökte, kvinnor som de ibland hade pekat ut för mig på gatorna och som föreföllo mig motbjudande. Det gjorde väl också till, att min fantasi alltid hade fått växa på egen hand och sköta sig själf nästan utan all beröring med kamraternas. Jag var ju alltid så mycket yngre än de, jag förstod i början ingenting när de talade om sådana saker, och emedan jag ingenting förstod, vande jag mig att icke höra på. Så förblef jag »ren». Icke ens gossårens synder gjorde jag någonsin bekantskap med, visste knappt ens hvad det var. Jag hade ingen religiös tro som höll mig tillbaka, men jag gjorde mig drömmar om kärleken, o, mycket vackra drömmar, och jag var viss om att de skulle förverkligas en gång. Jag ville inte sälja min förstfödslorätt för en grynvälling, ville inte smutsa min hvita mössa.","But during all that time my operating life lay in a slumber, lively enough to arouse indefinite dreams and desires, as in a young girl, but not powerful and inviting as in other young men. And if I also occasionally watched through a night in hot fantasies, it always seemed inconceivable to me that I could find satisfaction in the women my comrades visited, women whom they had sometimes pointed out to me in the streets and who seemed disgusting to me. It probably also meant that my imagination had always had to grow on its own and take care of itself almost without any contact with the comrades. I was always so much younger than them, I did not understand anything at first when they talked about such things, and because I did not understand anything, I got used to not listening. So I remained ""pure."" Not even the sins of the boyhood years I ever became acquainted with, barely even knew what it was. I had no religious beliefs that held me back, but I made dreams of love, oh, very beautiful dreams, and I was sure that they would come true once. I did not want to sell my birthright for a gruel, did not want to soil my white hat.","But all this time my instinctive drives were half asleep, aroused enough to awaken vague dreams and desires, like those of a young girl, but not powerful and tempting like other young men’s. And though I did occasionally lie awake at night with hot fantasies, it was still unthinkable to me that I would be able to find satisfaction with the women my friends visited, women they sometimes pointed out to me on the street, who seemed repulsive. No doubt the fact that my imagination evolved entirely on its own, completely independent from the influence of others, also played a role. I was always so much younger than my peers that at first I didn’t understand a thing when they talked about these matters, and since I didn’t understand, I grew accustomed to not listening. So I remained “pure.” I didn’t even practice the sins of youth—I barely knew they existed. I had no religious faith to hold me back, but I had my dreams of love, such beautiful dreams, and I was convinced that one day they would be reality. I didn’t want to sully my student honors, sell my birthright for a pittance.","During all those years other instincts had lain half-asleep; they had been enough, certainly, to stir up vague dreams and desires, as in a young girl; but not mighty, imperious, as in other young men. And even if from time to time I lay awake at nights, indulging myself in hot fantasies, yet it always seemed to me unthinkable that I should find satisfaction with the women my comrades visited, women they had sometimes pointed out to me on the streets, but who to me appeared merely disgusting. This must also have been one reason why my imagination grew so solitarily, almost out of touch with my schoolfellows’. After all, I was so much younger than they were. Therefore when they talked of such things I at first understood nothing; and, understanding nothing, became accustomed not to listen. In this way I remained ‘pure’, not even making the acquaintance of boyhood sins; scarce knowing what they were. I had no religious faith to sustain me, yet I made up my own dreams of love, oh yes, very beautiful dreams, and one day, I was sure, they would come true. But I had no desire to sully my white student cap or sell my birthright for a mess of pottage."

"Jag hade inte på åratal varit i en kyrka. Jag mindes hur jag som fjorton, femton års pojke hade suttit i dessa samma bänkar och bitit ihop tänderna i ursinne mot den feta utspökade skurken vid altaret och tänkt för mig själf, att den där humbugen kanske skulle kunna räcka i tjugu, högst trettio år ännu. En gång under en lång, tråkig predikan fattade jag det beslutet att själf bli präst. Jag tyckte att de präster jag sett och hört voro stympare i sitt yrke och att jag skulle kunna göra allt det där mycket bättre än de. Jag skulle stiga högt, bli biskop, ärkebiskop. Och när jag väl blifvit ärkebiskop – då skulle man få höra på roliga predikningar! Då skulle det bli folk i Uppsala domkyrka! Men innan prästen hunnit till amen var min historia redan slut: jag hade en god vän i skolan som jag talade med om allting; jag var kär i en flicka; och så hade jag min mor. För att kunna bli biskop måste jag ju ljuga och göra mig till också för dessa, och det var omöjligt. Några måste man ha, som man kan vara uppriktig för ... Ja, herregud, den tiden, den oskyldiga tiden ... Det är underligt att sitta och tänka sig tillbaka in i en stämning och en tankekrets från längesedan gångna år. På sådant känner man tidens flykt. Förvandlingens lag, som prästen sade (det har han för resten huggit ur någon Ibsenpjäs). Det är som att se en gammal fotografi af sig själf. Och jag tänkte vidare: hur lång tid kan jag ännu ha kvar att irra omkring på måfå i denna gåtornas och drömmarnas och de otydbara fenomenens värld? Kanske tjugu år, kanske mer ... Hvem är jag om tjugu år ...? Om jag vid sexton år genom något spökeri hade fått se i en syn mitt lif som det är nu, hur skulle det ha känts? – Hvem är jag om tjugu år, om tio år? Hvad tänker jag då om mitt lif af i dag? Jag har gått i väntan på erynnierna i dessa dagar. De ha inte kommit. Jag tror inte att det finns några. Men hvem vet ... De göra sig kanske ingen brådska. De tycka kanske att de ha god tid. Hvem vet hvad de kunna göra af mig med åren. – Hvem är jag om tio år?","I had not been to a church in years. I remembered how, as a fourteen, fifteen-year-old boy, I had sat on these same benches and clenched my teeth in rage against the fat ghostly villain at the altar, thinking to myself that that hoax might last for twenty, at most thirty years. . Once during a long, boring sermon, I made the decision to become a priest myself. I thought that the priests I had seen and heard were more mutilated in their profession and that I could do all that much better than them. I would rise high, become a bishop, an archbishop. And once I became archbishop - then you would hear funny sermons! Then there would be people in Uppsala Cathedral! But before the priest had time to amen, my story was already over: I had a good friend at school with whom I talked about everything; I was in love with a girl; and so I had my mother. To be able to become a bishop, I have to lie and pretend to these too, and that was impossible. You have to have some, for whom you can be sincere ... Yes, my God, that time, the innocent time ... It's strange to sit and think back into a mood and a circle of thoughts from long ago years. In such one feels the flight of time. The law of transformation, as the priest said (by the way, he has carved it out of some Ibsen play). It's like seeing an old photograph of yourself. And I thought further: how much time can I still have to wander around at random in this world of riddles and dreams and the indistinct phenomena? Maybe twenty years, maybe more ... Who am I in twenty years ...? If at sixteen I had seen through a ghost through a vision my life as it is now, how would it have felt? - Who am I in twenty years, in ten years? What do I think about my life today? I've been waiting for the erynnies these days. They have not come. I do not think there are any. But who knows ... They may not be in a hurry. They may think they have a good time. Who knows what they might do to me over the years. - Who am I in ten years?","I hadn’t been in a church for years. I remembered how at fourteen or fifteen I’d sat in these very pews, clenching my teeth in fury at the fat scoundrel at the altar in his absurd get-up, thinking to myself that this hoax might last for twenty, even thirty more years. Once, during a long, boring sermon I decided to become a minister myself. I thought the ones I’d seen and heard were miserable representatives of the profession and that I’d be able to do all that much better than they did. I would attain great heights, become a bishop, then archbishop. And when I’d become archbishop—then there’d be entertaining sermons! Then people would flock to Uppsala Cathedral! But even before the minister said “amen” my career was over: I had a good friend at school with whom I discussed everything; I was in love with a girl; and then there was my mother. To become bishop I’d have to lie and put on an act even for them, and that was impossible. There have to be some people with whom one can be sincere . . . Oh, Lord, that was then, in those days of innocence . . . It’s strange to sit here trying to recapture a mood, a way of thinking, from long ago. This sort of thing makes one feel the passage of time. The law of change, as the preacher said (for that matter he’d stolen it from some Ibsen play). It’s like examining an old photograph of yourself. And I also thought: how much longer can I still have left to meander without purpose through this world of riddles and dreams and inexplicable phenomena? Perhaps twenty years, perhaps more . . . Who will I be in twenty years? If, at sixteen, through some sort of hocus pocus I’d had a vision of my life as it is now, how would I have felt? Who will I be in twenty years, in ten? What will I then think of my present-day life? These past days I’ve been waiting for the Furies. They haven’t come. I don’t think there are any. But who knows . . . Perhaps they’re not in a hurry. Perhaps they think they have plenty of time. Who knows what they could do to me over time? Who will I be ten years from now?","It was many years since I had been in a church. I recalled how, as a boy of fourteen or fifteen, I had sat in these same pews, grinding my teeth with fury at the fat scoundrel in his get-up at the altar, and thinking to myself how all this humbug perhaps might last yet another twenty, or at most thirty, years. Once, during a long dreary sermon, I decided to become a clergyman myself. It seemed to me the clergy I had seen and heard were mere bunglers at their job, and that I could do all this far better myself. I should rise, become a bishop, archbishop. And, once an archbishop—by jove, then people would hear some funny sermons! Then there would be crowds in Uppsala Cathedral! But before the clergyman had got to his Amen my story was already over: I had a close friend at school with whom I used to discuss everything; I was in love with a girl; and then, too, I had my mother. To become a bishop I should have had to have lied and pretended to them, too; and that was impossible, A few people, there must always be, one can be honest with…. O Lord, that time, that innocent time…. Strange it is to sit and let one ’s thoughts carry one back to a mood and a mental world of long ago. Thus one feels the flight of time. The law of change, the preacher was saying, (he’s got that out of some play by Ibsen, by the bye). It is like seeing an old photograph of oneself. And I thought, too: how long a time can be left me still to wander about at random in this world of enigmas and dreams and phenomena that elude interpretation? Twenty years, maybe; maybe more …? If by some ghostly means I had been able at sixteen to see in a vision my life as it is now, how would I have felt? —Who am I in twenty years, in ten? What shall I think, then, of my life today? These days I have been expecting a visit from the Furies. They haven’t put in an appearance. I don’t believe such things exist. But, who knows—Perhaps they are in no hurry. Perhaps they think they have plenty of time. Who knows what, given a few years, they can do to me?—Who am I in ten years?"
"Och ändå höll jag af honom. Kanske mest därför att han var så stolt öfver mitt goda hufvud. Och också därför att han alltid var så fint klädd. En tid hatade jag honom också, därför att han inte var god mot min mor. Men så blef hon ju sjuk och dog. Jag märkte då, att han sörjde henne mera än jag själf förmådde med mina femton år, och då kunde jag ju inte hata honom längre.","And yet I loved him. Maybe mostly because he was so proud of my good head. And also because he was always so nicely dressed. For a while I hated him too, because he was not kind to my mother. But then she got sick and died. I noticed then that he mourned her more than I myself could with my fifteen years, and then I could not hate him anymore.","But I did love him, mostly, perhaps, because he was so proud of my sharp mind, and also because he was always so elegantly dressed.

"Jag undrar hvilken bild hon kan ha gjort sig af mig. Hon känner mig inte. I hennes lätta hjärna, som bara rymmer några ömma och vänliga tankar på dem som stå henne nära, och dessutom kanske litet skräp, har det formats en bild som har några yttre drag af mig, men som icke är jag, och i den bilden har hon funnit behag, vill det synas – gud vet hvarför, kanske hufvudsakligen därför att jag är ogift. Men om hon kände mig, om hon till exempel af en slump skulle råka få läsa hvad jag skrifver på dessa lappar om kvällarna, ja, då tänker jag att hon med en skygg men riktig instinkt skulle draga sig undan från de vägar där jag går fram. Jag tänker att svalget mellan våra själar är litet väl stort. Eller hvem vet: om man skall ge sig i äktenskap, är det kanske tvärtom en lycka att svalget är så stort – vore det mindre, kunde jag bli frestad att söka fylla det, och det slutade aldrig väl! Den kvinna, som jag kan blotta mig för, finns inte. Men ändå: att lefva sida vid sida med henne och aldrig släppa henne in i det som verkligen är jag och mitt – får man göra så med en kvinna? Låta henne famna en annan i tron att det är jag – får man göra så?","I wonder what image she may have taken of me. She does not know me. In her light brain, which contains only a few tender and kind thoughts of those close to her, and also perhaps a little rubbish, an image has been formed which has some external features of me, but which is not me, and in that image has she has found pleasure, it wants to be seen - god knows why, maybe mainly because I'm unmarried. But if she knew me, if she, for example, by chance should happen to read what I write on these notes in the evenings, well, then I think that she with a shy but real instinct would withdraw from the roads where I walk . I think the gulf between our souls is a little too big. Or who knows: if you are going to get married, it is perhaps on the contrary a blessing that the throat is so big - if it were smaller, I could be tempted to try to fill it, and it never ended well! The woman I can expose myself to does not exist. But still: to live side by side with her and never let her into what really is me and mine - can you do that with a woman? Let her embrace another in the belief that it's me - can you do that?","I wonder what sort of image she has of me. She doesn’t know me. In her untroubled heart, which contains merely a few kind, tender thoughts about her nearest and dearest, and perhaps a little nonsense as well, an image has been created that has some of my external characteristics, but which isn’t me, and that image is pleasing to her, apparently— God knows why, perhaps primarily because I’m unmarried. But if she knew me—if, for instance, by chance she should happen to read what I write on these pieces of paper in the evening—then I think her instinct would caution her to shy away from me. I think the chasm between our souls is too wide. Or who knows: when it comes to marriage, perhaps it’s actually an advantage if the chasm is wide—if it were smaller, I might be tempted to try to bridge it, and that could never end well. The woman I could reveal myself to doesn’t exist. But still: to live by her side and never give her access to my true self, my real concerns—could I treat a woman that way? Let her embrace a stranger believing it ’s me—could I do that?","I wonder what image she can have formed of me. In her light heart, which contains only a few gentle and friendly thoughts about those close to her and perhaps a little rubbish besides, an image has formed, having certain outward features that are mine, but which is not me, and in that image, it seems, she is well pleased—God knows why, perhaps chiefly because I am unmarried. But if she really knew me, if by some chance for instance she happened to read what I write on these scraps of paper in the evenings, well then, I fancy she would shun the paths I walk in. I should think the gulf between our souls is a bit too broad. But who knows? When entering marriage it is fortunate, perhaps, if the gulf is as broad as this—if it were narrower, I should perhaps be tempted to try and fill it in, and that would never turn out well! But even so: to live side by side with her and never give her access to that which is truly me and mine—can one treat a woman so? Let her embrace another, believing it to be me—is it permissible to do such a thing?"

Det visste jag egentligen förut, men jag hade alltid tänkt mig, att svängningstiderna måste vara sekler eller tidehvarf – nu föreföllo de mig som minuter och sekunder. Det skimrade för mina ögon, och som den enda ledtråden genom häxdansen förnam jag åter en gång rösten i mitt inre, rösten som hviskade mellan tänderna: akta dig, präst!","Never have I had such a strong feeling that morality is a carousel that goes around. I really knew that before, but I had always imagined that the oscillation times must be centuries or a time warp - now they seemed to me like minutes and seconds. It shone before my eyes, and as the only clue through the witch's dance, I once again felt the voice within me, the voice that whispered between my teeth: beware, priest!","Never have I felt with greater force that morality is a spinning merry-go-round. I knew this before, of course, but I’d always imagined that the revolutions must be measured in centuries or eons. Now they seemed like minutes or seconds. I grew dizzy, and the only guidepost through the madness was the voice I heard inside me, the voice whispering between its teeth: watch out, pastor!","Never have I had so strong a feeling that morality is a merry-go-round, a spinning top.

"Då jag hann upp henne var hon redan bland de andra, jag kunde bara trycka hennes hand i tysthet, och hon tryckte min tillbaka. Därnere på ängen gick dansen ännu kring majstången, pigor och drängar och herrskapsfolkets ungdom om hvarandra, som det brukas den enda natten på året. Jag förde henne i dansen på nytt, en vild och yr dans blef det; det var redan full dager, men med midsommarnattens häxeri ännu kvar i luften, hela jorden dansade under oss, och de andra paren susade förbi än högt öfver oss, än långt nedanför, allt gick upp och ner och rundt omkring. Så kommo vi till sist ut ur de dansandes hvirfvel, vi vågade icke se på hvarandra men smögo oss bort tillsammans utan ett ord, bakom en syrenhäck. Där kysste jag henne åter. Men det var något annat nu, hennes hufvud låg tillbakalutadt mot min arm, hon slöt ögonen, och hennes mun blef ett lefvande väsen under min kyss. Jag tryckte min hand mot hennes bröst, och jag kände hennes hand lägga sig öfver min – kanske var det hennes mening att värja sig, att föra undan min hand, men i verkligheten tryckte hon den blott hårdare mot sitt bröst. Men under tiden steg det ett skimmer öfver hennes ansikte, först svagt, sedan starkare, till sist som ett våldsamt eldsken, hon öppnade ögonen men måste sluta dem på nytt, bländad, och när vi så ändtligen hade kysst den långa kyssen till slut, stodo vi kind mot kind och stirrade häpna rakt in i solen, som bröt fram ur molnskockarna i öster.","When I caught up with her she was already among the others, I could only press her hand in silence, and she pushed mine back. Down in the meadow, the dance still revolved around the Maypole, maids and servants, and the youth of the lords about each other, as is customary the only night of the year. I brought her into the dance again, it became a wild and dizzying dance; it was already full days, but with the midsummer night's witchcraft still in the air, the whole earth danced beneath us, and the other couples whizzed past even high above us, far below, everything went up and down and around. So we finally got out of the dancers' vortex, we did not dare to look at each other but snuck away together without a word, behind a lilac hedge. There I kissed her again. But it was something else now, her head was reclining against my arm, she closed her eyes, and her mouth became a living being under my kiss. I pressed my hand against her chest, and I felt her hand rest over mine - maybe it was her intention to defend herself, to move my hand away, but in reality she only pressed it harder against her chest. But meanwhile a shimmer rose over her face, first faint, then stronger, finally like a violent glow of fire, she opened her eyes but had to close them again, dazzled, and when we had finally kissed the long kiss at last, stood we cheek to cheek and stared in amazement straight into the sun, which broke out of the clouds in the east.","When I caught up with her she was already with the others; I could only press her hand in silence, and she pressed mine back. Down in the meadow people were still dancing around the Maypole, serving maids and farm hands and young people from well-to-do homes all mixing with each other, as is the custom on this one night of the year. I led her into the dance again, and a wild, dizzy dance it was; it was already full daylight, but the bewitchment of the Midsummer night was still in the air. The whole earth danced under us and the other couples whirled past, first above us, then below; everything went up and down and spun around. Then finally we pulled ourselves out of the vortex of the dance. We didn’t dare look at each other but stole away together, without a word, behind a lilac hedge. There I kissed her again. But now it was different—her head rested leaning back on my arm, she closed her eyes, and her mouth came alive as I kissed her. I pressed my hand against her breast and I felt her hand over mine. Perhaps she meant to ward me off, to push my hand away, but in fact she merely pressed it harder against her breast. All the while her face was growing radiant, first faintly, then more strongly, and finally like a violent flame. She opened her eyes but had to close them again, blinded, and when finally our long kiss was over, we stood cheek to cheek, dazed, and stared directly into the sun, which had broken through the patches of clouds in the east.","When I caught up with her she was already with the others and all I could do was silently squeeze her hand, and she pressed mine in response. Down there in the field they were still dancing round the maypole, country girls and farmhands all mixed up with the young gentry, as the custom is on this one night of the year. Again I took her into the dance, a wild and dizzy dance; already it was broad daylight but was the midsummer witchery still in the air; the whole earth danced under us and the other couples flew past, now high above us, now far beneath; everything went up and down, and round and round. So at last we escaped out of the swirling confusion of dancers and, not daring to look at one another, crept away without a word behind a hedge of lilac. There I kissed her again. But now it was something else, her head lay back on my arm, she closed her eyes, and her mouth became a living thing under my kiss. I pressed my hand against her breasts, and I felt her hand lay itself on mine—perhaps she meant to defend herself, or remove my hand, but in fact she only pressed it harder to her breast. Meanwhile a radiance came over her face, faint at first, then stronger, and at last like a violent flash; she opened her eyes, but was forced to close them again, blinded; and when at last we had kissed our long kiss to its end, we stood cheek to cheek, staring amazed straight into the sun which had burst out of the cloud-layers to the east."

"Det känns dock lugnt och godt att veta, att dessa små inmjölade kulor, som likna blyhagel, ligga där och vänta på den dag, då de kunna behöfvas. I dem slumrar det en kraft, ond och förhatlig i sig själf, människans och allt lefvandes hufvudfiende från begynnelsen.

"Kyrkans tegeltorn står så rödt i kvällssolen. Trädkronornas grönska är så mäktig och mörk just nu, och det blå där bakom är så djupt. Det är lördagskväll; små fattiga barn hoppa hage nere på sandgången. I ett öppet fönster sitter en man i skjortärmarna och blåser flöjt. Han blåser intermezzot ur Cavalleria rusticana. Det är underligt med melodier och deras smitta. För knappt tio år sedan steg denna melodi upp ur kaos och smög sig på en fattig italiensk musiker, kanske en kväll i skymningen, kanske en kväll som denna. Den befruktade hans själ, den födde andra melodier och andra rytmer och gjorde honom i förbund med dem i ett slag till en världsberömdhet och gaf honom ett nytt lif med ny glädje och nya sorger och en förmögenhet att spela bort i Monte Carlo. Och melodien breder ut sig som en plötslig smitta hela världen rundt och gör sin ödesbestämda gärning på godt och ondt, färgar kinder röda och kommer ögon att glänsa, blir beundrad och älskad af otaliga och väcker leda och äckel hos andra, ofta hos de samma som älskade den först; ringer envist och obarmhärtigt i den sömnlöses öron om natten, retar affärsmannen som ligger och grämer sig öfver att aktierna som han sålde i förra veckan ha stigit, stör och pinar tänkaren som vill samla sin tanke till att formulera en ny lag, eller dansar omkring i tomrummet i en idiots hjärna. Och medan mannen, som »skapade» den, kanske är mera utpinad och led vid den än någon annan, rifver den ännu kväll efter kväll skallande applådsalfvor af publiken på all världens förlustelseställen, och mannen där borta blåser den med känsla på sin flöjt.","The brick tower of the church is so red in the evening sun. The greenery of the treetops is so powerful and dark right now, and the blue behind it is so deep. It's Saturday night; small poor children jumping pasture down the sand passage. In an open window, a man sits in his shirt sleeves and blows his whistle. He blows the intermezzo from Cavalleria rusticana. It's weird with tunes and their contagion. Almost ten years ago, this melody rose out of chaos and crept up on a poor Italian musician, maybe one night at dusk, maybe one night like this. It fertilized his soul, it gave birth to other melodies and other rhythms and made him allied with them in one fell swoop to a world fame and gave him a new life with new joy and new sorrows and a fortune to play off in Monte Carlo. And the melody spreads like a sudden contagion all over the world and does its fateful deed for good and evil, colors cheeks red and will make eyes shine, is admired and loved by countless and arouses sadness and disgust in others, often in those who loved it first; rings stubbornly and relentlessly in the sleepless ears at night, teases the businessman who lies and complains that the shares he sold last week have risen, disturbs and torments the thinker who wants to gather his thoughts to formulate a new law, or dances around in the void in an idiot's brain. And while the man who ""created"" it may be more tormented and afflicted by it than anyone else, it still tears night after night raging applause from the audience at all the loss places in the world, and the man over there blows it with emotion on his flute.","The brick steeple of the church is very red in the evening light.

Barely ten years ago, this melody arose from the chaos and sneaked up on an impoverished Italian musician, perhaps one evening in the twilight, perhaps on an evening like this. It bore fruit in his soul, giving birth to other melodies and other rhythms, and all of a sudden, with their help, he became world famous, bringing him a new life with new joys and new sorrows and a fortune to gamble away in Monte Carlo. And the melody, like an epidemic, catches on throughout the world and has its fateful effect, both good and bad—makes cheeks blush and eyes shine, is admired and loved by countless people and arouses boredom and disgust in others, often the same people who initially loved it; rings insistently and mercilessly in the ears of the insomniac at night, annoys the businessman who lies fretting because the stocks he sold last week have risen, disturbs and pains the thinker trying to gather his thoughts to formulate a new law, or dances around in the vacuum of an idiot’s brain. And while the man who “created” it may be more pained and tired of it than anyone else, audiences in places of entertainment all over the world continue to applaud it wildly, and the man over there plays it with feeling on his flute.","The brick tower of the church looks so red in the evening sun.

And all the while, as the man who ‘created’ it, perhaps more than any other, is sickened and plagued by it, it calls forth salvoes of applause evening after evening from the public in every place of entertainment on earth; and the man over there plays it with feeling on his flute."

"Nå, jag är nu ingen Schopenhauer; då jag såg prästen komma emot mig på långt håll, det var på Vasabron, stannade jag hastigt och ställde mig att se på utsikten med armarna stödda mot broräcket. Helgeandsholmens grå hus, den gamla badstuns söndriga götiska träarkitektur som speglades bruten i det rinnande vattnet, de stora gamla pilarna, som doppade sina blad i strömmen. Jag hoppades att prästen inte hade sett mig och att han inte heller skulle känna igen min ryggtafla, och jag hade redan i det närmaste glömt honom, då jag plötsligt fick se honom stå bredvid mig med armarna på broräcket liksom jag och hufvudet på sned – i alldeles samma attityd som för tjugu år sen i Jakobs kyrka, då jag satt i familjebänken vid min salig mors sida och för första gången såg denna förskräckliga fysionomi skjuta upp i predikstolen som en otäck svamp och klämma i med sitt abba, käre fader. Samma feta, grådaskiga ansikte, samma smutsgula polisonger, litet gråa nu kanske, och samma outgrundligt gemena blick bakom glasögonen. Omöjligt att komma undan, jag är ju hans läkare nu liksom många andras, och han kommer till mig ibland med sina krämpor. – Se god afton, herr pastor, hur står det till. – Inte bra, inte riktigt bra, hjärtat är dåligt, bultar ojämnt, stannar ibland om nätterna, tycker jag. – Det gläder mig, tänkte jag, du kan gärna dö, din gamla rackare, så slipper jag se dig mera. Du har för resten en ung och vacker hustru, som du förmodligen pinar lifvet ur, och när du dör gifter hon om sig och skaffar sig en mycket bättre man. Men högt sade jag: jaså, jaha, pastorn kanske kommer upp till mig en af dagarna, så får vi se hur det är fatt. Men han hade mycket mera att tala om, viktiga saker: det är ju en rent af onaturlig värme och det är dumt att det skall byggas ett stort riksdagshus på den lilla holmen där, och min hustru är för resten inte heller riktigt kry.","Well, I'm no Schopenhauer now; when I saw the priest coming towards me from a distance, it was on Vasabron, I stopped quickly and stood to look at the view with my arms propped against the bridge railing. Helgeandsholmen's gray house, the old sauna's broken gothic wooden architecture that was reflected broken in the running water, the big old arrows, which dipped their leaves in the stream. I hoped that the priest had not seen me and that he would not recognize my backboard, and I had already almost forgotten him, when I suddenly saw him standing next to me with his arms on the bridge railing like me and my head at an angle - in exactly the same attitude as twenty years ago in Jacob's church, when I sat in the family pew by my blessed mother's and for the first time saw this terrible physiognomy shoot up in the pulpit like a nasty sponge and squeeze in with his abba, dear father. The same fat, greyish face, the same dirty yellow sideburns, a little gray now perhaps, and the same unfathomably mean look behind the glasses. Impossible to get away, I am his doctor now like many others, and he comes to me sometimes with his ailments. - Good evening, Mr. Pastor, how are you? - Not good, not really good, the heart is bad, beats unevenly, sometimes stays at night, I think. - I'm glad, I thought, you can die, you old rascal, I'll not see you anymore. By the way, you have a young and beautiful wife, from whom you probably torment life, and when you die she remarries and gets a much better husband. But I said out loud: well, well, maybe the pastor will come up to me one of these days, and we'll see how it goes. But he had much more to talk about, important things: it is a purely unnatural heat and it is foolish to build a large parliament building on the small islet there, and my wife is not really well either.","Well, I’m no Schopenhauer, of course. When I saw the pastor approaching me from a distance on Vasa Bridge, I quickly stopped and positioned myself, leaning on the rail, to admire the view: the gray buildings of Helgeand Isle, the old, worn wooden bath house in Viking style, reflected in the rippling current, the ancient willows dipping their leaves in the Stream. I hoped the pastor hadn’t seen me and wouldn’t recognize me from behind, and I had more or less put him out of my mind when I realized he was standing next to me, leaning on the rail just as I was, his head cocked to the side—in precisely the same posture as the time twenty years ago in St. Jacob’s Church when, sitting beside my late mother in the family pew, I first saw that dreadful physiognomy stick up from the pulpit like a poisonous mushroom and start droning his “Our Father.” The same puffy, sallow face, the same dirty yellow sideburns—a bit grayer now, perhaps—the same inscrutable, mean look from behind the glasses. No possibility of escape now—he’s one of my many patients, and sometimes he comes to me with his aches and pains. “Well, good evening, Pastor, how are you?” “Not well, not well at all. My heart’s bad—irregular heartbeat. Sometimes at night it almost seems to stop.” Pleased to hear it, I thought. Go ahead and die, you old scoundrel, and I’ll be rid of the sight of you. Besides, you have a beautiful young wife you’re probably tormenting to death, and if you die she’ll remarry and find a much better husband. But aloud I said, “Oh, I see. Well, perhaps you should stop by my office one of these days and we’ll look into the matter.” But he had a good deal more to say, important things like this heat is quite extraordinary, and it’s stupid to build a big house of parliament on that little island, and as a matter of fact, my wife isn’t really well, either.","Well, I’m not Schopenhauer. When I saw the parson coming towards me in the distance across the Vasa Bridge I halted abruptly and, turning, leaned my arms on the parapet to admire the view. Grey houses on Helgeand Island. The crumbling wooden architecture of the old Nordic-style bath-house, reflected in The Stream, in whose flowing waters the grand old willows trail their leaves. I hoped the clergyman hadn’t seen me, or wouldn’t recognise my rear-view. Indeed, I’d almost forgotten him, when suddenly I realised he was standing beside me, his arms like mine resting on the parapet and his head cocked a little to one side—exactly the same pose as twenty years ago, in Jacob’s Church, when I used to sit in the family pew beside my late lamented mother, and first saw that odious physiognomy, like a nasty fungus, hop up in the pulpit and heard him strike up with his Abba Father. Same greyish pudgy face; same dirty yellow side-whiskers, now greying slightly, perhaps: and that same unfathomably mean look behind the spectacles. Impossible to escape! I’m his doctor now, as I am many others’. And sometimes he comes to me with his aches and pains.—Well, well … good evening, Vicar, And how are you?—Not too good; in fact not at all well. My heart’s bad, thumps irregularly, sometimes stops at nights, so it seems to me.—Glad to hear it, I thought. For all I care you can die, you old rascal, and rid me of the sight of you. Besides, you’ve got a pretty young wife, whom you’re probably plagueing the life out of, and when you die she’ll remarry and get herself a much better husband. But aloud I said: Really? Really? That so? Perhaps you’d better come and see me one of these days. We’ll look into the matter. But there was a lot more than this he wanted to talk about. Important things : It’s quite simply unnatural, this heat. And: It’s stupid, building great big parliament buildings on that little island. And: My wife isn’t really well, either, if it comes to that."
"Nej, jag förstår det icke. Hvarför skall det vara så, hvarför skall det alltid bli så? Hvarför skall kärleken vara trollguldet, som andra dagen blir vissna löf, eller smuts, eller ölsupa? Ur människornas längtan efter kärlek har ju hela den sidan af kulturen spirat upp, som icke direkt syftar till hungerns stillande eller försvar mot fiender. Vårt skönhetssinne har ingen annan källa. All konst, all dikt, all musik har druckit ur den. Den tarfligaste moderna historiemålning lika väl som Rafaels madonnor och Steinlens små parisiska arbeterskor, »Dödens ängel» likaväl sum Höga visan och Buch der Lieder, koralen och Wienervalsen, ja hvarje gipsornament på det tarfliga hus där jag bor, hvarje figur i tapeten, formen på porslinsvasen där och mönstret i min halsduk, allt som vill pryda och försköna, det må nu lyckas eller misslyckas, stammar därifrån, fast på mycket långa omvägar ibland. Och det är intet nattligt hugskott af mig, utan bevisadt hundra gånger.","No, I do not understand. Why should it be so, why should it always be so? Why should love be the magic gold, which on the second day becomes withered leaves, or dirt, or beer soup? From the people's longing for love, the whole side of culture has sprung up, which does not directly aim at calming hunger or defending against enemies. Our sense of beauty has no other source. All art, all poetry, all music has drunk out of it. The craziest modern history painting as well as Raphael's Madonnas and Steinlen's little Parisian working women, 'Angel of Death' as well as the High Song and Buch der Lieder, the coral and the Viennese waltz, yes every plaster ornament on the meager house where I live, every figure in the wallpaper, the shape of the porcelain vase there and the pattern in my scarf, everything that wants to adorn and beautify, it may now succeed or fail, originates from there, but on very long detours sometimes. And it is not a nocturnal shot of me, but proven a hundred times.","No, I don’t understand it. Why is it like this, why will it always be like this? Why is love fool’s gold that turns into withered leaves on the second day, or into filth or dissipation? The longing for love has inspired all human culture that rises above the level of basic survival. Our sense of beauty has no other wellspring. All art, all literature, all music has drunk from it. The most crude historical painting as well as Raphael’s madonnas and Steinlen’s little Parisian working girls, Wallin’s psalm “The Angel of Death” as well as the Song of Songs and Heine’s Buch der Lieder, the chorale and the Viennese waltz, yes, every plaster of Paris ornament on the wretched building where I live, every figure in the wallpaper, the shape of the porcelain vase over there and the pattern of my scarf, everything intended to be decorative or beautiful, whether or not it succeeds, comes from this, though sometimes in a roundabout way. And this is no nocturnal flight of fancy of mine; it’s been proven a hundred times over.","No, I don’t understand it. Why must it be like this, why must it always be like this? Why must love be the troll’s gold that on the morrow turns to withered leaves, filth, or beery indulgence? Does not all that side of our culture not directly designed to still hunger, or defend us against our enemies, spring from mankind’s longing for love? Our love of beauty knows no other source. All art, all poetry, all music has drunk at it. The most insipid modern historical painting, every bit as much as Raphael’s madonnas and Steinlen’s little Parisian working girls; ‘The Angel of Death’ as the Song of Songs; and Das Buch der Lieder, the Chorale and the Viennese waltz, yes, every plaster ornament on this dreary house I live in, every figure on the wallpaper, the form of the china vase over there, the pattern on my scarf, everything made to delight or embellish—no matter whether, successful or unsuccessful—springs from this origin, albeit often by the longest and most circuitous of routes. Nor is this a brainwave of mine, born of the night, but something proven a hundred times over."
"Jag sitter vid mitt öppna fönster nu och skrifver detta – för hvem? För ingen vän och för ingen väninna, knappt för mig själf ens, ty jag läser icke i dag hvad jag skref i går och kommer icke att läsa detta i morgon.

Jag har ju inte begått något brott.","I'm sitting by my open window now writing this - for whom?

Jag började förstå ... Jag frågade:,I began to understand ... I asked:,"I was beginning to understand . . . I asked, “Has something in particular happened just now . . .",I began to understand. I asked:
"Det är sant: om detta sker, så kan det ju hända att hon kommer till mig och ber mig att »hjälpa» henne med samma slags hjälp som så många förgäfves ha tiggt mig om – och gör hon det: – ja, så får jag väl då göra henne till viljes, ty jag vet inte hur jag skall kunna göra henne emot i något. Men så är jag också led vid det hela, och så får historien vara slut, hvad min andel beträffar.","It's true: if this happens, it may be that she comes to me and asks me to ""help"" her with the same kind of help that so many have begged me for in vain - and she does: - yes, I get well then do her will, for I do not know how I shall be able to oppose her in anything. But then I'm also sad at the whole thing, and so the story must end, as far as my share is concerned.","True, if this happens, it’s possible she might come to me and ask me to “help” her in the same way so many others have begged for in vain, and if she does—well, then I suppose I’ll do as she asks, for I don’t know how I could oppose her wishes in anything. But then I’d be weary of the whole business and my part in the story would be over.","True: if this happens, then it’s possible she will come to me and ask me to ‘help’ her with the same sort of help so many have begged for in vain—and if she does, well then, I suppose I shall have to accede, because I do not see how I can resist her in anything. But that’s the end of the matter as far as I’m concerned."
"– Jag vill handla. Lif är handling. Då jag ser något som upprör mig vill jag gripa in. Jag griper icke in hvar gång jag ser en fluga i ett spindelnät, ty spindlarnas och flugornas värld är icke min, och jag vet att man måste begränsa sig, och jag tycker inte om flugor. Men om jag ser en liten vacker insekt med guldskimrande vingar i nätet, då rifver jag sönder det och dödar spindeln om det behöfs, ty jag tror inte på att man inte får döda spindlar. – Jag går i skogen; jag hör nödrop; jag springer efter skriket och finner en man i begrepp att våldföra en kvinna. Jag gör naturligtvis hvad jag kan för att befria henne, och om det blir nödvändigt, dödar jag mannen. Lagen ger mig ingen rätt därtill. Lagen ger mig rätt att döda en annan blott till nödvärn, och med nödvärn menar lagen blott värn i yttersta nöd för eget lif. Lagen tillåter mig icke att döda någon för att rädda min far eller min son eller min bästa vän, och icke för att skydda min älskade för misshandel eller våldtäkt. Lagen är löjlig, kort sagdt, och ingen anständig människa låter sitt handlingssätt bestämmas af den.","- I want to shop. Life is action. When I see something that upsets me, I want to intervene.

"Jag gick ett slag ut på Skeppsholmen på eftermiddagen. Strax jag kommit öfver bron mötte jag Recke; han kom ned från höjden där kyrkan ligger. Han gick långsamt och tittade i marken med framskjuten underläpp och petade undan småsten med käppen, och han såg inte ut att vara riktigt nöjd med sin värld. Jag trodde inte att han skulle se mig, men just som vi passerade hvarann såg han upp och nickade markeradt hjärtligt och muntert, med en blixtsnabb omläggning af hela ansiktsuttrycket. Jag fortsatte min väg, men hejdade mig efter ett par steg: hon är säkert inte långt härifrån, tänkte jag. Kanske står hon kvar däruppe på höjden. De ha haft något att säga hvarandra och stämt möte däruppe, dit sällan någon kommer, och för att inte bli sedd tillsammans med honom har hon låtit honom gå ner först. Jag satte mig på bänken, som går rundt kring stammen på den stora balsampoppeln, och väntade. Jag tror att det är det största träd som finns i Stockholm. Många vårkvällar satt jag som barn under det trädet med min mor. Far var aldrig med; han tyckte inte om att gå ut och gå med oss.","I went out on Skeppsholmen in the afternoon. As soon as I crossed the bridge I met Recke; he came down from the height where the church is located. He walked slowly and looked at the ground with his protruding lower lip and poked away pebbles with his cane, and he did not seem to be really happy with his world. I did not think he would see me, but just as we passed each other he looked up and nodded markedly heartily and cheerfully, with a lightning-fast change of the whole facial expression. I continued on my way, but stopped myself after a few steps: she is certainly not far from here, I thought. Maybe she's still up there on the hill. They had something to say to each other and arranged a meeting up there, where rarely anyone comes, and in order not to be seen with him, she let him go down first. I sat down on the bench, which goes around the trunk of the large balsam poplar, and waited. I think it is the largest tree in Stockholm. Many spring evenings I sat as a child under that tree with my mother. Dad was never with; he did not like to go out and join us.","I took a walk on Ship’s Isle this afternoon. Just after crossing the bridge I met Recke; he’d come down from the hilltop where the church is. He was walking slowly, staring at the ground, his lower lip protruding, poking aside the gravel with his stick, and he didn’t seem very content with the world. I didn’t think he would notice me, but just as we passed each other he looked up and, instantly transforming his entire expression, gave a slightly forced, hearty, cheerful nod. I went on, but stopped after a few paces: she’s sure to be nearby, I thought. Maybe she’s still up there on top of the hill. They’d had something to discuss and had agreed to meet up there, where people seldom go, and to avoid being seen with him she’d let him walk down first. I sat down on the bench that encloses the trunk of the enormous poplar tree, waiting. It must be the largest tree in Stockholm. As a child I often sat under it on spring evenings with my mother. My father was never along; he didn’t like going on walks with us.","I walked out to Skeppsholmen in the afternoon. Just across the bridge I met Recke: he was coming down from the hill where the church is. He walked slowly, looking at the ground, underlip thrust out, knocking pebbles out of his way with his stick. He didn’t seem exactly pleased with his existence. I thought he wouldn’t see me; but just as we passed each other he looked up and nodded in a gay and hearty manner there was no mistaking, his whole face changing expression. I went on my way, but halted after a few steps. She can’t be far away, I thought. Perhaps she’s still up there on the hill. They’ve had something to say to each other and have had a rendezvous up there where hardly anyone ever goes; and so as not to be seen with him she has let him go down first. I sat down on the bench which surrounds the poplar, and waited. I should think it must be the biggest tree in Stockholm. Many a spring evening in my childhood have I sat beneath this tree with my mother. Father never came; he didn’t like taking walks with us."

"Han tog ett piller utan vidare frågor och sväljde ner det med en klunk vatten. Jag tyckte att mitt hjärta stod stilla. Jag stirrade rätt framför mig. Torget låg tomt och ökentorrt.

"Där var ungdom och dans och lekar. Bland ungdomsskaran fanns en flicka, som jag hade träffat några gånger förr, på bjudningar i familjer. Jag hade icke tänkt på henne mycket förut, men då jag nu såg henne där, rann det mig plötsligt i sinnet hvad en kamrat till mig hade sagt om henne en gång på en bjudning: den där flickan har allt ett godt öga till dig, hon har suttit och sett på dig hela kvällen. Detta erinrade jag mig nu, och fast jag inte trodde det utan vidare, gjorde det i alla fall att jag såg mera på henne än jag kanske annars skulle ha gjort, och jag märkte också att hon såg på mig ibland. Hon var kanske inte vackrare än många andra, men hon stod i de tjugu årens fulla blomma, och hon hade ett tunnt hvitt bluslif öfver det unga bröstet. Vi dansade några gånger med hvarandra kring majstången. Inemot midnatt gingo vi allesammans upp på ett berg för att se på utsikten och tända ett midsommarbål, och det var meningen att vi skulle stanna där tills solen gick upp. Vägen gick genom skogen mellan höga raka tallar; vi gingo par om par, och jag gick med henne. Då hon snubblade mot en trädrot i skogsdunklet räckte jag henne min hand, det gick en ilning af glädje igenom mig då jag kände hennes lilla mjuka, fasta, varma hand i min, och jag behöll den sedan också där vägen blef jämn och lätt. Hvad talade vi om? Jag vet inte, inte ett ord har stannat i mitt minne, jag minns bara att det gick som en hemlig ström af tyst och beslutsam hängifvenhet genom hennes röst och genom alla hennes ord, som om detta att hon gick där i skogen hand i hand med mig var något som hon länge hade drömt om och hoppats på. Vi kommo upp på berget, andra ungdomar voro där före oss och hade redan tändt bålet, och vi lägrade oss i grupper och parvis här och där. Från andra höjder och berg flammade andra eldar. Öfver oss hängde rymden stor och ljus och blå, nedanför lågo vikarna och sunden och den vida fjärden isigt blanka och djupa. Jag höll ännu alltjämt hennes hand i min, jag tror också att jag vågade smeka den sakta. Jag betraktade henne förstulet och såg, att hennes hy glödde i nattens blekhet och ögonen stodo fulla af tårar, men hon grät icke, hon andades jämnt och lugnt. Vi sutto tysta, men inom mig sjöng det, en sång, en gammal visa som kom för mig, jag vet inte hur:","There were youth and dancing and games. Among the youth was a girl, whom I had met a few times before, at parties in families. I had not thought of her much before, but when I saw her there, it suddenly occurred to me what a friend of mine had said to her once at an invitation: that girl has a good eye for you, she have been sitting and watching you all evening. I remembered this now, and although I did not believe it without further ado, it did at least make me look at her more than I might otherwise have done, and I also noticed that she looked at me sometimes. She may not have been more beautiful than many others, but she was in the full bloom of her twenties, and she had a thin white blouse over her young breast. We danced a few times with each other around the maypole. Towards midnight we all went up a mountain to look at the view and light a midsummer bonfire, and we were supposed to stay there until the sun rose. The road went through the forest between tall straight pines; we went couple by couple, and I went with her. When she stumbled against a tree root in the forest darkness, I held out my hand to her, a rush of joy went through me when I felt her little soft, firm, warm hand in mine, and I then kept it even where the road became smooth and easy. What were we talking about? I do not know, not a word has remained in my memory, I just remember that it went like a secret stream of quiet and determined devotion through her voice and through all her words, as if this that she went there in the woods hand in hand with me was something she had long dreamed of and hoped for. We came up the mountain, other young people were there before us and had already lit the fire, and we camped in groups and in pairs here and there. From other heights and mountains other fires blazed. Above us hung the space large and light and blue, below lay the bays and the strait and the wide bay icy shiny and deep. I still held her hand in mine, I also think I dared to caress it slowly. I looked at her stealthily and saw that her skin glowed in the paleness of the night and her eyes were full of tears, but she did not cry, she breathed evenly and calmly. We sat silent, but inside me it sang, a song, an old song that came to me, I do not know how:","There were young people and dancing and games. In the crowd of young people was a girl I’d met a few times at family gatherings. I hadn’t thought much about her before, but as I looked at her now a friend’s remark at a party suddenly came to mind: that girl certainly has an eye for you—she’s been sitting there watching you all evening. I remembered this now, and though I didn’t really believe it, it did make me look at her more than I might have otherwise, and I noticed that she sometimes looked at me, too. She may not have been prettier than many others, but she was in the full bloom of her twenty years and she was wearing a thin white blouse over her young breasts. We danced together a few times around the Maypole. As midnight approached we all climbed up a hill to admire the view and light a Midsummer bonfire, and the plan was to stay there until sunrise. The way up was through the woods between tall, straight pines; we walked in couples, and I walked with her. When she tripped on a tree root in the dim forest light I reached out my hand; a tremor of happiness went through me when I felt her soft, warm, firm little hand in mine, and I kept hold of it even when the path became straight and smooth. What did we talk about? I don’t know. Not a word remains in my memory, I only recall that it was as if there was a hidden current of quiet, resolute devotion in her voice and in every word she spoke, as if walking in the woods with me, hand in hand, was something she’d long been dreaming about and hoping for. We reached the top; other young people were already there and had lit the bonfire, and we settled down in scattered groups or two by two. From other heights and hilltops other fires flared up. Above us the sky was huge and light and blue, below the icy inlets and straits and the wide bay were shiny and deep. I was still holding her hand, and I think I even caressed it softly. I looked at her shyly and saw that her complexion was glowing in the pale night and her eyes were full of tears, but she wasn’t crying; her breathing was calm and even. We sat quietly, but inside me a song arose, an old folk song that came to me from nowhere in particular:","There was youth, and dancing, and games. Among the young people was a girl. I had already met her a few times at family parties, but until then I had not thought much about her. But now when I saw her there, something a schoolmate had once said about her at a party came into my mind: That girl certainly has an eye to you, she’s been looking at you the whole evening! Now I recalled this, and although I did not exactly believe it, yet it made me observe her more closely than I might otherwise have done. I noticed, too, that she looked at me from time to time. She was, perhaps, no more beautiful than many another; but she was in the full bloom of her twenty years and over her young breasts she wore a thin white blouse. We danced together a few times round the maypole. Towards midnight we all went up on to a knoll to look out over the wide countryside where a midsummer bonfire was to be lit, our intention being to stay until sunrise. The path led through the forest, between tall straight pines; we went two by two, and I was walking beside her. She stumbled over a root in the shadowy forest and I gave her my hand, and a thrill of pleasure passed through me as I felt her little soft, firm, warm hand in mine. So I went on holding it, even where the path was smooth and easy. What did we talk about? I don’t know, not a word has remained in my memory, all I remember is that a secret current of silent and determined devotion flowed through her voice and all her words, as if this action of walking together with me hand in hand through the forest was something she had long dreamed of and hoped for. We came to the hilltop. The other youngsters, having arrived before us, had already lit the bonfire, and we gathered in groups and scattered couples. Above us the sky hung vast and light and blue; below us lay the creeks and sounds and the deep wide channels, shining like ice as they stretched away into the distance. Still I held her hand in mine, and I believe I also plucked up courage to stroke it slowly. I stole glances at her and saw how her skin seemed to glow in the night ’s pallor and how her eyes were full of tears, though she wasn’t crying, and her breath came quiet and even. Silent, we sat there together. But inside me it was as if I was singing a song, an old song which came to mind , I don’t know how:"

"Öfver patiencekorten på mitt bord ligga bladen af en sönderplockad ros. Jag vet inte hvarför jag satt och plockade bladen af den.

"– Ja, sade Birck, man kunde åtminstone nöja sig med att hålla lyktorna släckta ett par tre nätter vid midsommar, då det verkligen nästan är ljust. På landet är sommarnattsskymningen ett helt trolleri, men här hör den inte hemma. Tända ljus tillhör staden. Aldrig har jag känt lyckan och stoltheten öfver att höra hemma i en stad starkare, än då jag som barn kom in från landet någon höstkväll och såg det tindra af ljus rundt kajerna. Nu, tänkte jag, nu måste de stackarna där borta på landet hålla sig inne i stugan eller också stöfla omkring i mörker och smuts.","""Yes,"" said Birck, ""one could at least be content with keeping the lanterns off for a couple of nights at midsummer, when it really is almost bright."" In the country, the twilight of the summer night is a complete magic, but here it does not belong. Lighted candles belong to the city. I have never felt the happiness and pride of belonging in a city stronger than when, as a child, I came in from the country one autumn evening and saw the twinkle of light around the quays. Now, I thought, now those poor people over there in the country have to stay inside the cottage or also stumble around in the dark and dirt.","Spare me.” “Yes,” said Birck, “if only they were content to leave the lamps off for a few nights around Midsummer, when it really is nearly light. In the country the summer twilight has a special charm, but it doesn’t belong here. Artificial light is part of the city. I’ve never felt more proud and happy to live in a city than I did as a child when I came in from the country on an autumn evening and saw the lights shining along the quays. Now, I thought, now those poor souls out in the country have to stay in their cottages or stumble around in darkness and filth.","—Yes, Birck agreed, they could at least content themselves with putting out the lights for two or three nights around midsummer, when it really is almost daylight. Out in the country these twilit summer nights of ours are quite magical, but here they don’t belong at all. Street lights are a proper ingredient of a town. I’ve never felt the happiness and pride of being a townsman so keenly as in my childhood when I came into town of an autumn evening and saw the lamps alight round the quays. Now, I thought to myself, now those poor wretches out there in the country have got to stay indoors if they don’t want to stump about in darkness and filth."
"Jag tycker inte så mycket om herrskapet för resten, när jag ser närmare på dem. Frun är ung och rätt vacker ännu, men hon har lagt litet på hullet och fått nästan väl blomstrande hy.

Skall jag döma honom efter utseendet och fasonerna, så är jag böjd för att tro att han är så otrogen som en tupp. Dessutom ha bägge det där sättet att gräla på kyparen i förskott för den försumlighet som de vänta af honom: ett sätt, som gör mig illamående.

"Markel: – Ja, ärelysten ...Om jag skall kalla honom ärelysten så är det väl mest för vår stora vänskaps skull, annars uttrycker man sig nog riktigare om man säger, att han vill komma fram. Ärelystnad är något så sällsynt. Vi ha vant oss att kalla en person för ärelysten om han vill bli statsråd. Statsråd, hvad är det? Inkomster som en mindre grosshandlare och knappt så mycket makt att han kan hjälpa fram sina släktingar, långt mindre drifva igenom sina idéer, om han har några. Det hindrar naturligtvis inte att jag själf gärna skulle vilja bli statsråd, det är ju alltid en förmånligare plats än den jag har – men man skall bara inte kalla det ärelystnad. Det är något annat. På den tiden då jag var ärelysten gjorde jag upp en för resten mycket vackert uttänkt plan att eröfra hela jorden och ordna om förhållandena, så att allt blef som det skulle vara; och när det så till sist blef så bra, att det nästan började bli tråkigt, då skulle jag stoppa på mig så mycket pengar jag behöfde och smyga mig bort, försvinna i någon millionstad och sitta i ett kaféhörn och dricka absint och ha min glädje af att se på hur galet allting gick sedan jag drog mig tillbaka ... Men jag tycker nu om Klas Recke i alla fall, därför att han är vacker, och därför att han har en ovanlig talang att ställa det litet hyggligt och trefligt för sig här i jämmerdalen.","Markel: - Yes, the ambition ... If I am to call him the ambition, it is probably mostly for the sake of our great friendship, otherwise you probably express yourself more correctly if you say that he wants to come forward. Ambition is something so rare. We have become accustomed to calling a person ambitious if he wants to become a minister. Minister, what is it? Income as a small wholesaler and barely so much power that he can help his relatives, far less drive through his ideas, if he has any. Of course, that does not stop me from wanting to become a minister myself, it is always a cheaper place than the one I have - but you should just not call it ambition. It's something else. At the time when I was ambitious, I made up a very beautifully devised plan to conquer the whole earth and rearrange the conditions, so that everything became as it should be; and when it finally got so good that it almost started to get boring, then I would put on as much money as I needed and sneak away, disappear in some million-dollar city and sit in a cafe corner and drink absinthe and have my fun of to look at how crazy everything went since I withdrew ... But I now like Klas Recke anyway, because he is beautiful, and because he has an unusual talent to put it a little decent and nice here in the Jämmer valley.","Markel: “Well, ambitious . . . If I were to call him ambitious it would be for the sake of our close friendship. Otherwise it would probably be more accurate to say that he wants to get ahead. Ambition is quite unusual. We’re used to saying that someone is ambitious if he wants to be a government minister. A minister—what’s that? The income of a small businessman and barely enough power to be able to help his own relatives, let alone push through his ideas, should he happen to have any. Which doesn’t stop me from wanting to be a minister myself, of course —it’s a more advantageous position than my current one—but this shouldn’t be called ambition. It’s something quite different. Back when I was ambitious I came up with a plan, a very carefully thought-out one, incidentally, to conquer the entire world and arrange things so that everything was as it should be, and finally, when it was so perfect that it almost began to be dull, then I’d help myself to as much money as I wanted and sneak off, disappear in an enormous city and sit in the corner of a café drinking absinthe, rejoicing about how badly everything was going since I’d withdrawn from the fray . . . But I like Klas Recke anyway, because he’s very handsome, and because he has an unusual talent for arranging things comfortably and pleasantly for himself in this vale of tears.”","MARKEL:—Yes, ambitious…. If I say he’s ambitious it’s mostly for the sake of our close friendship; otherwise one would be putting the matter more correctly if one said he wants to get on in life. Ambition is something so rare. We’ve got into the habit of calling someone ambitious if he wants to become a minister of state. Minister of state—what’s that? A petty wholesaler’s income and hardly enough power to be able to help one’s own relatives, much less impose one’s ideas, if one has any. I don’t mean to say I wouldn’t mind being a minister myself, it’s certainly a better job than the one I’ve got—only it shouldn’t be called ambition. It’s something else. In the days when I was ambitious I worked out a very pretty little plan for conquering the whole earth and rearranging things as they ought to be; and when, in the end, everything became so good it almost began to be boring, then I was going to stuff my pockets with as much money as I could lay hands on and creep away, vanish in some cosmopolis and sit at a corner café and drink absinth and enjoy seeing how everything went to the devil as soon as I wasn’t on the scene any more….

Det var ingen rullgardin nerfälld; hon behöfver ingen, det är stora obebyggda tomter med brädgårdar och sådant på andra sidan gatan, ingen kan se in. Jag såg heller ingenting, ingen mörk gestalt, ingen arm eller hand som rördes, bara gult lampsken på musslinsgardinen. Jag tänkte: hvad gör hon nu, hvad sysslar hon med? Läser i en bok, eller sitter med hufvudet i händerna och tänker, eller reder sitt hår för natten ... Å, om jag vore där, om jag fick vara där hos henne ... Ligga där och se på henne och vänta, medan hon reder sitt hår framför spegeln och långsamt löser upp sina kläder ... Men inte som en början, en första gång, utan som ett led i en lång, god vana. Allt, som har en början, har också ett slut. Det skulle hvarken få ha början eller slut.","I randomly drove through the streets. I came to the house where she lives. It shone in one of her windows. There was no blind down; she needs no one, there are large undeveloped plots with sawmills and such on the other side of the street, no one can see inside. I also saw nothing, no dark figure, no arm or hand that was touched, just yellow lamplight on the mussel curtain. I thought: what is she doing now, what is she doing? Reading in a book, or sitting with his head in his hands and thinking, or combing his hair for the night ... Oh, if I were there, if I could be there with her ... Lie there and look at her and wait, while she straightens her hair in front of the mirror and slowly dissolves her clothes ... But not as a beginning, a first time, but as part of a long, good habit. Everything that has a beginning also has an end. It would have neither beginning nor end.","I wandered randomly through the streets. I came to the building where she lives. There was a light in one of her windows. No shades had been drawn; she doesn’t need any. On the opposite side of the street are just large vacant lots filled with lumber and such; no one can look in. I couldn’t see anything, either—no dark figure, no arm or hand moving, just the yellow light of the lamp on the muslin curtain. I thought: what can she be doing now, what occupies her? Reading a book or sitting with her head in her hands thinking, or fixing her hair for the night . . . Oh, if only I were there, if only I could be there with her . . . Lie there watching her, waiting while she fixes her hair in front of the mirror and slowly loosens her clothes . . .

"– Stjärnorna, sade Markel, duga inte att lysa oss på våra irrfärder i natten. Det är sorgligt i hvilken grad de ha förlorat all praktisk betydelse. Förr reglerade de hela vårt lif; och när man öppnar en vanlig fjortonöres almanacka skulle man kunna tro att de göra det ännu. Det vore svårt att leta upp ett mera slående exempel på traditionens seghet än detta, att den mest spridda folkbok som finns är fylld med noggranna uppgifter om saker som ingen människa längre bryr sig om. Alla dessa astronomiska tecken, som den fattigaste bonde för två hundra år sedan förstod på ett ungefär och som han studerade med ifver och flit, då han trodde att all hans välfärd berodde af dem, äro i dag okända och obegripliga för mängden af bildade. Om vetenskapsakademien hade sinne för skämt, kunde den roa sig med att blanda om Kräftan, Lejonet och Jungfrun i almanackan som lotter i en hatt, allmänheten skulle inte märka det ringaste. Stjärnhimmeln har sjunkit ner till en rent dekorativ roll.","- The stars, said Markel, are not enough to illuminate us on our wanderings at night. It is sad to what extent they have lost all practical significance. In the past, they regulated our entire lives; and when you open an ordinary fourteen - ear calendar, you would think they still do. It would be difficult to find a more striking example of the toughness of tradition than this, that the most widespread folk book that exists is filled with accurate information about things that no human being cares about anymore. All these astronomical signs, which the poorest farmer two hundred years ago understood roughly, and which he studied with zeal and diligence, when he thought that all his welfare depended on them, are today unknown and incomprehensible to the multitude of educated. If the Academy of Sciences had a mind for jokes, it could have fun mixing the Cancer, the Lion and the Virgin in the almanac as lottery tickets in a hat, the public would not notice the slightest thing. The starry sky has sunk to a purely decorative role.","“The stars,” said Markel, “can no longer manage to light our way in the night. The degree to which they’ve lost all practical importance is lamentable. Once they ruled our lives, and if you look in an ordinary Farmer’s Almanac you might think they still do. It would be difficult to find a more striking example of the persistence of tradition than this—that the most widely circulated popular publication in existence is full of detailed information about matters no human being pays attention to any longer. All these astronomical signs that two hundred years ago any poor farmer more or less understood and studied tirelessly and with zeal, since he believed his well-being depended on them—today they’re unknown and incomprehensible to most educated people. If the Academy of Science had a sense of humor it could amuse itself by randomly mixing up Cancer, Leo, and Virgo in the almanac—the public wouldn’t notice a thing. The constellations have been degraded to a purely decorative role.”","—The stars, said Markel, simply aren’t up to lighting our footsteps as we wander about in the night. It’s sad to see how they’ve lost all practical importance. Once they regulated our whole life; and to open an ordinary penny-halfpenny almanack one would think theystill did. It would be difficult to find a more striking instance of the toughness of tradition than the fact that the most popular almanacks are full of detailed information on matters which no living person any longer cares a fig for. All these astronomical signs which the poorest peasant had some idea of two hundred years ago and studied diligently, believing his whole well-being depended on them,—today they’re unknown, incomprehensible, to most educated people. If the Academy of Science had any sense of humour it could amuse itself by shuffling the Crab, the Lion and the Virgin in its almanack, like lottery tickets in a hat, and the public wouldn’t be any the wiser. The starry sky today has sunk to a purely decorative role."

"Om man tar in litet cyankalium i ett glas vin eller något liknande, följer döden ögonblickligen, glaset faller ur handen ner på golfvet, och det är tydligt för hvar och en att det föreligger ett själfmord. Det är inte alltid bra. Om man däremot tar ett af mina piller och dricker ett glas vatten på, dröjer det en eller annan minut innan pillret hinner lösas upp och göra verkan, man kan lugnt ställa glaset tillbaka på brickan och sätta sig i en bekväm stol framför brasan och tända en cigarr och vika upp Aftonbladet. Plötsligt sjunker man ihop. Läkaren konstaterar ett slaganfall. Sker obduktion, upptäcks naturligtvis giftet. Men då inga misstänkta eller ur medicinsk synpunkt särskildt intressanta omständigheter föreligga, sker ingen obduktion. Och man kan icke säga att det föreligger några sådana omständigheter om en person får slag medan han läser Aftonbladet vid sin middagscigarr.","If you take a little cyanide in a glass of wine or something similar, death follows immediately, the glass falls from your hand onto the golf course, and it is clear to everyone that there is a suicide. It's not always good. If, on the other hand, you take one of my pills and drink a glass of water, it takes a minute or two before the pill has time to dissolve and take effect, you can calmly put the glass back on the tray and sit in a comfortable chair in front of the fire and light one cigar and unfold Aftonbladet. Suddenly you collapse. The doctor diagnoses a stroke. If an autopsy takes place, the poison is of course discovered.

There’s plenty of time to put the glass back on the tray and settle into a comfortable armchair by the fire, light a cigar, and open the Evening News. Suddenly you collapse. The doctor diagnoses a stroke or heart attack. If there’s an autopsy, naturally the poison is discovered, but if the circumstances aren’t suspicious or of any particular medical interest, there is no autopsy. And there’s nothing very remarkable about a stroke while smoking a cigar and reading the Evening News.","If you take a little potassium cyanide in a glass of wine or suchlike, death follows instantly.

"Plötsligt kände jag igen henne. Det var samma unga kvinna som en gång hade vridit sig i gråt på golfvet i mitt rum och tiggt och bedt att jag skulle hjälpa henne – att jag skulle befria henne från barnet som hon väntade.

"Nyss, då jag gick hemåt öfver kyrkogården, såg jag åter en af dessa scener, om hvilka de moraliska insändarna i pressen bruka säga, att de trotsa all beskrifning. Det är tydligt, att en drift, som kan förmå dessa stackars människor att väcka allmän förargelse på en kyrkogård, måste vara oerhördt mäktig och stark. Den drifver lättsinniga män till alla slags galenskaper, och hederliga och förståndiga män drifver den till att underkasta sig stora umbäranden och försakelser i andra hänseenden. Och den drifver kvinnorna till att öfvervinna den blygselkänsla, som all flickuppfostran i generationer efter generationer har varit anlagd på att väcka och förstärka, till att uthärda förfärliga kroppsliga lidanden, och ofta till att störta sig på hufvudet i det djupaste elände.","Recently, as I was walking home across the cemetery, I saw again one of these scenes, about which the moral submitters in the press used to say that they defied all description. It is clear that a drive that can persuade these poor people to arouse public indignation in a cemetery must be extremely powerful and powerful. It drives frivolous men to all kinds of madness, and honest and prudent men drive it to submit to great hardships and renunciations in other respects. And it drives women to overcome the feeling of shyness that all girls' education for generations has been designed to arouse and strengthen, to endure terrible physical suffering, and often to plunge into the depths of the deepest misery.","Just now as I crossed through the churchyard on my way home I once again witnessed one of those scenes that guardians of morality who write letters to the newspaper always call “beyond description.” Clearly an instinct that makes these poor people flout public outrage in a churchyard must be overwhelmingly powerful. It drives frivolous men to all sorts of insane behavior and makes honest, sensible men submit to great deprivation and hardship. And it drives women to overcome the sense of modesty that their upbringing, generation after generation, has been designed to promote and reinforce, to endure terrible physical suffering, and often to plunge headfirst into the deepest misery.","Just now as I crossed the churchyard I saw again one of those scenes of which letters to the newspapers are in the habit of saying they ‘defy description’. Obviously an instinct that can compel these wretched people to flout all convention in a churchyard must be an immensely strong and powerful one. It drives frivolous men into all sorts of mad pranks, and forces honest intelligent men to subject themselves to every sort of tribulation and sacrifice. As for women, it drives them to surmount those feelings of modesty which the education of generation upon generation of young girls has been designed to awaken and develop, and causes them to suffer terrible bodily torments and often plunge into deepest misery."
"En hustru borde väl egentligen också höra till saken. Men det har nu sina sidor. Jag har så svårt att fördraga den tanken att någon ser på mig medan jag sofver. Ett barns sömn är vacker, en ung kvinnas också, men knappast en mans. Man säger att en hjältes sömn vid lägerelden, med ränseln till hufvudgärd, skall vara vacker att se, och det är möjligt, ty han är så trött och sofver så godt. Men hur kan mitt ansikte se ut, när tanken ligger i dvala? Jag ville knappt se det själf om jag kunde, än mindre bör någon annan se det.","A wife should really be a part of it too.

But what can my face look like when the thought is dormant? I hardly wanted to see it for myself if I could, much less should anyone else see it.","I suppose a wife really ought to be part of the arrangement. But that creates problems, too.

For oneself there are always special circumstances that justify an exception.","There was never really anything peaceful about my father. He was rarely cheerful, and when he wasn’t, could not abide the cheerfulness of others. But he liked parties; he was of the company of melancholy wastrels. He was rich, and died poor. To this day I do not know whether he was completely honest; after all, he was involved in such big transactions. How I pondered, as a child, some words I once heard him let fall in jest to one of his business acquaintances: “Well, my dear Joseph, it isn’t so easy to be honest when one is earning such big money as we are….” But he was strict and hard and had perfectly clear and definite ideas about duty, where others were concerned. For oneself one can always find circumstances that alter cases."
"Å, dumheter. När drömmar och varsel börja slå in, och det icke är fråga om pigor och gamla fruntimmer utan om högre organiserade individer, då säger psykiatrien att det är ett tecken till begynnande andlig desorganisation. Men hur förklaras det? Det förklaras så, att man i de allra flesta fall aldrig har drömt det som »slår in»; man tycker att man har drömt det, eller också att man har upplefvat alldeles detsamma en gång förr, in i de minsta detaljer. Men min dröm med de mörka blommorna har jag uppskrifven! Och blommorna själfva, de äro ingen hallucination, de stå där och dofta och äro lefvande, och någon har kommit hit med dem.","Oh, stupidity. When dreams and omens begin to strike, and it is not about maids and old ladies but about higher organized individuals, then psychiatry says that it is a sign of incipient spiritual disorganization. But how is it explained? It is explained that in most cases one has never dreamed of what ""strikes""; you think you have dreamed it, or you have experienced exactly the same thing once before, down to the smallest detail. But I have written down my dream with the dark flowers! And the flowers themselves, they are no hallucination, they stand there and smell and are alive, and someone has come here with them.","Oh, what foolishness! When dreams and premonitions begin to come true, and not just for serving girls and old women but for more sophisticated individuals, psychiatry claims it’s a sign of beginning mental deterioration. But how can the phenomenon be explained? The explanation is that in the vast majority of cases, what “comes true” never was dreamed in the first place, it just seems to have been a dream, or a previous experience, absolutely identical to the last detail. But I’ve written down my dream about the dark flowers! And the flowers themselves—they’re no hallucination, they’re standing over there, fragrant and blooming, and someone brought them here.","What nonsense. When dreams and premonitions begin to come true and it isn’t a question of servant-maids and old women but more highly organised individuals, then psychiatry says it is a sign of incipient psychic disintegration. But how explain it? The explanation is that in the great majority of cases one has never dreamed what ‘comes true’; we think we have dreamed it or that we have gone through precisely the same thing before, even to the minutest detail. But my dream with the dark flowers I have written down! And the flowers themselves, they are no hallucination, they stand there, alive, I can smell them, and someone has come here with them."

"Bacillerna – det gick upp ett ljus för mig då jag hörde honom uttala detta ord. Jag kände alldeles tydligt igen tonfallet, jag erinrade mig att jag hade hört honom tala om baciller någon gång förut, och det stod med ens klart för mig, att han led af den sjukdom som kallas bacillskräck. Bacillerna stå tydligen i hans ögon på något mystiskt sätt utanför både religionen och den sedliga världsordningen. Det kommer sig af att de äro så nya. Hans religion är gammal, nära nitton hundra år, och den sedliga världsordningen daterar sig åtminstone från århundradets början, från den tyska filosofin och Napoleons fall. Men bacillerna ha kommit öfver honom på hans ålderdom, alldeles oförberedt. De ha i hans föreställning först i dessa yttersta dagar börjat sin obehagliga verksamhet, och det har aldrig fallit honom in, att det efter allt att döma fanns massor af baciller också i det enkla lerkrus, som gick bordet rundt vid afskedsmåltiden i Getsemane.","The bacilli - a light came on for me when I heard him utter this word. I recognized the tone quite clearly, I remembered that I had heard him talk about bacilli at some point before, and it was suddenly clear to me that he was suffering from a disease called bacilli fear. The bacilli apparently stand in his eyes in some mysterious way outside both religion and the moral world order. It's because they're so new. His religion is old, nearly nineteen hundred years old, and the moral world order dates back at least to the beginning of the century, to German philosophy and the fall of Napoleon. But the bacilli have come over him in his old age, completely unprepared. It is only in these performances that they have begun their unpleasant activities in his last days, and it has never occurred to him that there seemed to be plenty of bacilli in the simple clay jar that went around the table at the farewell meal in Gethsemane.","Germs—I suddenly had an idea when I heard the way he pronounced the word. I recognized his tone of voice quite clearly and remembered I’d heard him talk about germs on some previous occasion; all of a sudden I realized he was suffering from a kind of phobia. In his eyes, germs in some mysterious way are impervious both to religion and to the moral order of the world. That’s because they’re so new. His religion is ancient, nearly nineteen hundred years old, and the moral order of the world can be dated back at least to the beginning of the century, to German philosophy and the fall of Napoleon. But germs have descended on him in his old age, completely without warning. He imagines they’ve started going about their nasty business only in these uttermost days, and it’s never occurred to him that there presumably were plenty of germs in the simple clay bowl that was passed around the table at the Last Supper in Gethsemane.","As I heard him utter this word, a light dawned. Instantly, I recognised the tone of voice. Once before I recalled hearing him speak of germs; and now it was at once clear to me he was suffering from the disease known as bacillophobia. In his eyes, evidently, germs lie mysteriously beyond the pale equally of religion and our system of conventions. This, of course, is because they are so new. His religion is old, almost nineteen hundred years old, and as for our system of social conventions, it dates at very least from the beginning of the nineteenth century, from German philosophy and the fall of Napoleon. But germs, assailing him in his old age, have taken him completely off his guard. According to his way of seeing things it has not been until this lattermost age that they have begun their nasty activities, certainly it has never occurred to him that, as far as we can judge, there must also have been masses of germs in the simple earthenware pot which passed round the Table at the Last Supper in Gethsemane."
"Det har regnat och blåst hela natten. Den första höststormen. Jag låg vaken och hörde två grenar gnissla mot hvarandra i den stora kastanjen utanför mitt fönster. Jag minns att jag steg upp och satt vid fönstret en stund och såg skytrasorna jaga hvarandra. Reflexen från gaslyktorna gaf dem ett smutsigt tegelrödt och brandfärgadt sken. Jag tyckte att kyrkspiran krökte sig för stormen. Skyarna formade sig till gestalter, de blefvo till en vild jakt af smutsiga röda djäflar, som tutade i lurar och hvisslade och skreko och fläkte trasorna af hvarandras kroppar och gjorde alla sorters hor. Och medan jag satt där brast jag plötsligt i skratt: jag skrattade åt stormen. Jag tyckte att den gjorde för mycket väsen af affären. Det gick mig som juden, då åskan slog ner just medan han åt en fläskkotlett: han trodde att det var för fläskbitens skull. Jag tänkte på mig och mitt, och jag trodde att stormen tänkte på det samma. Till sist somnade jag på min stol. En köldrysning väckte mig, jag gick till sängs men somnade inte mer. Och så blef det då till sist en ny dag.","It has been raining and blowing all night. The first autumn storm. I lay awake and heard two branches squeaking at each other in the large chestnut tree outside my window. I remember getting up and sitting at the window for a while and watching the fireflies chase each other. The reflection from the gas lanterns gave them a dirty brick red and fire-colored glow. I thought the church spire curved before the storm. The clouds formed into figures, they became a wild chase of dirty red devils, who honked in lurks and whispered and screamed and fanned the rags of each other's bodies and made all sorts of adulterers. And while I was sitting there, I suddenly burst out laughing: I laughed at the storm. I thought it made too much sense of the deal. It occurred to me as the Jew, when the thunder struck just as he was eating a pork chop: he thought it was for the sake of the piece of pork. I thought of myself and mine, and I thought the storm thought of the same thing. Finally I fell asleep on my chair. A chill woke me up, I went to bed but did not fall asleep again. And so it finally became a new day.","IT’S BEEN RAINING and windy all night. The first autumn storm. I lay awake listening as two branches of the large chestnut rubbed against each other outside my window. I remember that I got up and sat by the window for a while watching the ragged clouds chase each other. The glow from the gas lights gave them a dirty, brick-red, fiery hue. It seemed as if the church spire bowed in the storm. The clouds formed figures, turning into a wild hunt of filthy red devils, blowing horns and whistling and howling and tearing the rags from each others’ bodies in wanton perversity. And as I sat there I suddenly burst out laughing: I laughed at the storm. I was reacting like the Jew when lightning struck just as he was eating a pork chop: he thought it was because of the pork. I was thinking of myself and my situation and assumed the storm did the same. Finally I fell asleep on my chair. I awoke with a shiver; once in bed I couldn’t fall asleep again. And then finally a new day came.","All night it has been raining and blowing. Autumn’s first storm. I lay awake listening to two boughs of the great chestnut tree outside my window creaking against each other. I remember I got up and sat by the window awhile, watching the ragged clouds chase one another across the sky. In the reflected gaslight they took on a dirty, fiery, brick-red glow. The church spire seemed to be bending to the storm. The clouds took on the shapes of dirty red devils blowing horns and whistling and screeching in wild pursuit as they whipped the rags off each other’s bodies in all sorts of whoredom. And as I sat there I suddenly burst out laughing: I laughed at the storm. I thought I was taking the whole affair altogether too seriously. I was acting like the Jew when lightning struck just as he was eating a pork chop; he thought it was for the chop’s sake. I was thinking of myself and my affairs; therefore I fancied the storm did the same. At length I dropped off to sleep in my chair. A cold shiver woke me. I went back to bed, but not to sleep. So at length a new day dawned."

Markel: Efter mitt enkla förstånd vore det tvärtom oförklarligt om hon hade den ringaste bråkdel af religion i behåll efter en passande tids äktenskap med pastor Gregorius – och för resten kan hon i hvart fall omöjligt vara mera religiös än madame de Maintenon.

På så sätt kommer det ljus i saken: mördaren var galen, det är förklaring nog, man behöfver inte söka efter någon annan, jag får en kristlig begrafning och Kristin får bekräftelse på hvad hon alltid i stillhet har misstänkt – ja, inte just alltid i stillhet.

De ärelystna förstår jag.

"Redan första gången jag såg henne slog det mig hur olik hon är alla andra. Hon liknar hvarken en dam af värld eller en medelklassfru eller en kvinna af folket. Kanske dock mest det sista, isynnerhet som hon nu satt där på kyrktrappan med det ljusa håret bart och fritt i solen, ty hon hade tagit af hatten och lagt den bredvid sig. Men en kvinna af ett ursprungligt folk eller af ett som aldrig funnits, ett där ingen klassbildning ännu begynt, där »folket» ännu icke blifvit underklass. En dotter af en fri stam.","The first time I saw her, it struck me how different she is from everyone else. She does not look like a lady of the world or a middle-class woman or a woman of the people. Perhaps most of all the last thing, especially as she now sat there on the church steps with her light hair bare and free in the sun, for she had taken off her hat and laid it beside her. But a woman of an original people or of one who has never existed, one where no class formation has yet begun, where the ""people"" have not yet become underclass. A daughter of a free tribe.","Even the first time I saw her it struck me how different she is from all others. She isn’t like a lady of the world or a bourgeois wife or a woman of the people, though perhaps that’s what she most resembles, especially now, sitting on the church steps, her blonde hair uncovered and exposed to the sun, for she’d taken off her hat and placed it beside her. But a woman from an indigenous people or one that has never existed, a society where classes haven’t been formed, where “the people” haven’t yet become the lower class. A daughter of a free tribe.","The very first time I ever saw her it struck me how unlike all others she is. She isn’t like a woman of the world, or a middle-class wife, or a woman of the people.

"– Jo, en gång har jag bedt honom om det. Men han svarade med en förmaning. Han sade att vi inte kunde veta, om inte Gud har för afsikt att skänka oss ett barn, fast vi inte ha fått något hittills, och därför skulle det vara en mycket stor synd om vi slutade upp med det som Gud vill att vi skall göra för att få barn ... Och han har kanske rätt. Men det är så svårt för mig.","- Yes, once I asked him for it. But he answered with an exhortation. He said we could not know if God did not intend to give us a child, even though we have not received anything so far, and therefore it would be a great sin if we ended up doing what God wants us to do. to have children ... And maybe he's right. But it's so hard for me.","“Yes, once I did ask him, but he answered by admonishing me. He said we couldn’t be sure whether or not God wanted us to have a baby, even though it hadn’t happened yet, and so it would be a very great sin to stop doing what God wants us to do in order to produce a baby . . . And perhaps he’s right. But it’s so hard for me.”","—Yes, I did ask him once. But he answered with a homily.

And perhaps he’s right. But it’s so hard for me."
"Det drog lång tid om efter detta, innan jag åter kände något af att jag var man och att det fanns kvinnor till i världen. Men då var jag härdad. Nu hade jag dock en gång känt en gnista från den stora flamman, och jag var mindre än någonsin böjd för att hålla tillgodo med talmikärlek. Andra må vara mindre nogräknade i den punkten, det får bli deras sak, och jag vet inte om hela frågan har någon så stor betydelse. Men jag kände, att den hade betydelse för mig. Och det vore dock väl naivt att tro, att icke en mans vilja skulle kunna reglera dessa bagateller, om blott viljan finns där. Käre Martin Luther, du pastor Gregorius’ värdige lärofader, hvilken syndare i köttet måste du inte ha varit, eftersom du pratade så mycket dumheter när du kom in på det kapitlet. Men du var dock uppriktigare än dina bekännare nu för tiden, och det skall man väl alltid hålla dig räkning för.","It took a long time after this, before I felt something again that I was a man and that there were more women in the world.

Others may be less careful on that point, it may be theirs, and I do not know if the whole question has any such significance. But I felt that it meant something to me. And yet it would be naive to think that not a man's will could regulate these trifles, if only the will were there. Dear Martin Luther, you pastor Gregory's worthy teacher, what a sinner in the flesh you must not have been, because you talked so much nonsense when you came to that chapter. But you were more sincere than your confessors these days, and you should always be held accountable for that.","After this it was a long time before I once again noticed I was a man and that there were women in the world.

And it would certainly be naive to think that a man’s will couldn’t control these insignificant urges, if only the will is there. Dear old Martin Luther, worthy spiritual ancestor of Pastor Gregorius, what a sinner in the flesh you must have been to have uttered so much nonsense when you got onto that topic! But at least you were more honest than your successors, and for that you should be praised.","A long while was to pass after this before I again felt I was a man or that there were such creatures as women in the world.

"– Nej, stjärnorna kan inte längre glädja sig åt samma popularitet som förr i världen. Så länge man trodde att ens öde hängde på dem, voro de fruktade men också älskade och dyrkade. Och som barn ha vi ju alla tyckt mycket om dem i tanke att de voro små vackra ljus, som Gud tände på om kvällarna för att glädja oss, och vi tänkte att det var åt oss de blinkade. Nu återigen, då vi ha fått veta litet mera om dem, äro de för oss bara en ständig, plågsam, oförskämd erinran om vår egen obetydlighet. Här går man till exempel en natt på Drottninggatan och tänker storartade, underbara, ja epokgörande tankar, tankar som man känner med sig att ingen människa i världen förr har förmått eller vågat tänka. Låt vara att en mångårig erfarenhet sitter på lur långt nere i vårt undermedvetna jag och hviskar, att vi nästa morgon utan det ringaste tvifvel antingen ha glömt dessa tankar eller icke längre ha blick för det storartade och epokgörande i dem – det gör detsamma, det minskar inte lyckan i tankeruset så länge det räcker. Men man behöfver bara råka titta uppåt och få se en liten stjärna sitta alldeles stilla mellan ett par plåtskorstenar och lysa och blinka, så förstår man att man lika gärna kan glömma dem strax. Eller man går och tittar i rännstenen och undrar, om man verkligen gör rätt i att supa ihjäl sig eller om man kanske kunde finna på något bättre att fylla ut tiden med. Så stannar man plötsligt – som det hände mig härom natten – och stirrar pa en liten tindrande punkt i rännstenen. Man finner efter en stunds reflexion att det är en stjärna som speglar sig – det var för resten Deneb i Svanen. Och med ens står det klart för en hur löjligt oviktig hela frågan är.","- No, the stars can no longer enjoy the same popularity as before in the world. As long as it was believed that one's destiny hung upon them, they were feared but also loved and worshiped. And as children, we all liked them a lot, considering that they were small beautiful candles, which God lit in the evenings to make us happy, and we thought that it was for us that they blinked. Now again, when we have learned a little more about them, they are to us only a constant, painful, rude reminder of our own insignificance. Here, for example, you walk one night on Drottninggatan and think magnificent, wonderful, even epoch-making thoughts, thoughts that you feel that no human in the world has ever been able or dared to think. Let it not be that many years of experience lie lurking deep in our subconscious self and whisper, that the next morning we will without the slightest doubt either have forgotten these thoughts or no longer have an eye for the great and epoch-making in them - it does the same, it diminishes not happiness in the rush of thought as long as it lasts. But you only need to look up and see a small star sitting completely still between a couple of sheet metal chimneys and shining and blinking, so you understand that you can just as easily forget them soon. Or you go and look in the gutter and wonder if you really do the right thing in drinking yourself to death or if you might be able to come up with something better to fill the time with. Then you suddenly stop - as happened to me the other night - and stare at a small twinkling point in the gutter. You find after a while of reflection that it is a star that is reflected - it was, after all, Deneb in the Swan. And suddenly it is clear to one how ridiculously unimportant the whole question is.","“No, the stars can’t pride themselves on the same popularity they once had. As long as people believed their fate depended on them they were feared, but also loved and worshipped. And as children we all liked them because we believed they were little candles God lit in the evenings for our own personal pleasure, and we thought they were twinkling for us. Now that we know a little more about them they’re merely a constant, painful, impertinent reminder of our own insignificance. Here you are, for instance, walking down a city street thinking magnificent, wonderful, even epoch-making thoughts, thoughts you’re certain no other human being in the world could or would dare to have. Let’s leave aside the fact that deep down in your subconscious, a voice based on many years of experience whispers that tomorrow morning, without the slightest doubt, you’ll have forgotten these thoughts or no longer see their magnificent and epoch-making qualities—that doesn’t matter, it doesn’t diminish the exhilaration and euphoria while it lasts. But all you have to do is look up and catch sight of a tiny star shining there all alone between a couple of metal chimneys, and you realize you might as well forget these thoughts right away. Or you look down into the gutter and wonder if it’s really such a good idea to drink yourself to death or whether you might be able to find some better way of passing the time. Then you suddenly stop—as I did the other night—and stare at a tiny, shining point in the gutter. After a moment’s consideration you realize it’s the reflection of a star—as a matter of fact it was Deneb in Cygnus, the Swan. And all of a sudden it’s clear to you just how absurdly trivial everything is.”","—No, the stars can’t congratulate themselves on enjoying at all the same popularity they once had. As long as one’s fate was believed to hang on them, they were feared, but also loved and worshipped. And as children, of course, we all liked them. We imagined they were pretty little lights God lit up in the evening to amuse us. We thought it was us they were winking at. But now we know rather more about them they’re only a constant, painful, insulting reminder of our own insignificance. One evening, maybe, one takes a stroll down Drottninggatan. One thinks thoughts, grandiose, yes, even epoch-making thoughts; thoughts no human being, one feels, has ever had the strength or courage to think in this world before. Admittedly, somewhere deep down in our unconscious, lurks the experience of many years, whispering that, without a shadow of doubt, tomorrow morning we shall either have forgotten these same thoughts or else have no eye for their grandiosity, their epoch-making qualities. It’s all one. As long as our thought-orgy lasts, nothing takes away an iota from our happiness. But one only has to look up by chance and see some tiny star sitting motionless between a couple of tin chimneys, shining and winking, to realise that one may as well forget them at once. Or else you go walking along, looking down into the gutter, wondering whether you’re really right to drink yourself to death, or whether, perhaps, there isn’t some better way of passing the time. Suddenly—and this really happened to me the other night—one stops, and gazes at a little sparkling point, down there in the gutter. A moment of reflection—and one realises it’s a star that’s mirrored there. To be precise it was Deneb, in the Swan. And at once it becomes obvious how absurdly unimportant the whole question is."
"Om ett par dar kommer prästen tillbaka – så börjar den gamla historien på nytt. Jag känner ju honom nu.

She may not even want it. And then: if this happens - when this happens - what then ...? Then the priest must leave.

But something tells me with great certainty, as if it had already happened, that soon she will carry a child under her heart. The way she loves now she’s not likely to be spared, and perhaps doesn’t even want to be. And then, if this happens—when this happens—what then? Then the pastor must go. Completely.","In a day or two the parson will be back—and the old tale begins all over again. I know him now.

"Ett ögonblick blef jag rädd. Jag tänkte: detta är en hallucination; jag börjar gå sönder, det lider mot slutet med mig. Jag vågade icke gå fram och taga blommorna i min hand af fruktan att gripa i tomma luften. Jag gick in i mitt arbetsrum. På skrifbordet låg ett bref. Jag bröt det med darrande fingrar i tanke att det kunde ha något samband med blommorna; rnen det var en middagsbjudning. Jag läste det och skref ett ord till svar på ett visitkort: »kommer». Så gick jag åter ut i salen: blommorna voro kvar. Jag ringde på Kristin; jag ville fråga henne hvem som hade kommit med blommorna. Men ingen kom på min ringning; Kristin var utgången. Det fanns ingen i våningen mer än jag.","For a moment I was scared. I thought: this is a hallucination; I'm starting to break, it's suffering towards the end with me. I did not dare to go forward and take the flowers in my hand for fear of seizing the empty air. I went into my study. On the desk was a letter. I broke it with trembling fingers thinking that it could have something to do with the flowers; rnen it was a dinner party. I read it and wrote a word in response to a business card: ""coming"". So I went out into the hall again: the flowers were still there. I called Kristin; I wanted to ask her who had brought the flowers. But no one came on my call; Kristin was the end. There was no one on the floor more than me.","For an instant I was frightened. I thought: this is a hallucination— I’m falling apart, the end is near.

I opened it with trembling hands, thinking there might be some connection to the flowers, but it was a dinner invitation. I read it and in reply wrote the word “Coming” on a visiting card. Then I went out into the parlor again. The flowers were still there. I rang for Kristin, but no one came— Kristin had gone out. There was no one in the apartment but me.","For a moment I was afraid. I thought: this is a hallucination; I’m beginning to go to pieces, this is the beginning of the end. I dared not go over and take the flowers in my hand for fear of grasping empty air.

"Och å andra sidan är allt, som står i samband med drömmens fullbordan, med driftens tillfredsställelse, och som följer af den, inför vår djupaste instinkt något oskönt och oanständigt. Detta kan icke bevisas, det är bara en känsla: min känsla, och jag tror egentligen allas. Människorna behandla alltid hvarandras kärlekshistorier som något lågt eller komiskt och göra ofta icke ens undantag för sina egna. Och sedan följderna ... En kvinna i grossess är något förskräckligt. Ett nyfödt barn är vedervärdigt. En dödsbädd gör sällan ett så ohyggligt intryck som en barnsbörd, denna förfärliga symfoni af skrik och smuts och blod.","And on the other hand, everything which is connected with the fulfillment of the dream, with the satisfaction of the operation, and which follows from it, is to our deepest instinct something ugly and indecent.

"Ja, hennes gång ... Jag måste ofrivilligt sluta ögonen, då hon gick förbi. Hon har en gång som en, som går mot sitt öde. Hon gick med hufvudet litet sänkt, så att en bit af halsen lyste hvit under den ljushåriga nacken. Log hon? Jag vet inte. Men jag kom plötsligt att tänka på min dröm härom natten.

A no longer young girl, who wanted to get married, once told me that she must cry when she saw the moon shining over a small cottage in the woods ... The moon is horny and lustful, says a poet. Another tries to instill an ethically religious tendency in the moonbeams and likens them to threads that are spun by loved ones into a net to catch a lost soul in ...

"»En gammal skalds skugga irrar i takrännan med den sorgsna rösten hos ett fruset spöke.» Det var tur för Baudelaire att han slapp höra hur det låter på svenska.

And finally, a court preacher had constructed a brand new kind of communion chalice, taken out a patent on it and formed a limited company - the pastor described it in detail to me, it seemed to be built on about the same idea as the magic and bottles of magic professors. - Well, Pastor Gregorius is for his part orthodox and not the least bit liberal, these news therefore seem to him all very worrying, but the bacilli are also worrying, and what to do?","For my part I thought it would look quite picturesque, but I said nothing and let him ramble on.

In short—yes, in capsules. And finally, a minister at court had constructed an entirely new kind of communion vessel, taken out a patent on it and set up a business. The pastor described it for me in detail—it seemed to be constructed along more or less the same lines as a magician’s equipment. Well, Pastor Gregorius himself is orthodox and not the slightest bit liberal, and consequently he finds all these ideas dreadfully alarming, but germs are alarming, too, and what’s to be done?","For my part I thought it would look rather picturesque; but I held my peace and let him continue.—Then , he went on, there was a clergyman of the modern, free-thinking variety who had suggested that Our Saviour’s blood could be swallowed in capsules.—At first I wondered if I had heard him aright. In capsules, like castor oil?—Yes, in capsules. Finally one of the Court Chaplains had constructed a communion cup of an entirely new sort, patented it and formed a limited company. The Vicar described the invention for me in detail. It seemed to be designed along more or less the same lines as a conjurer’s glasses and bottles. Well, the Rev. Gregorius, for his part, is orthodox. He is nothing of a free-thinker. These innovations, one and all, fill him with profound misgivings. But so, too, do germs. So what’s to be done?"

"Mina drömmar om kärleken – det tycktes mig en gång att de voro så nära, så nära att bli verklighet. Midsommarnatt, underliga bleka natt, alltid väcker du upp det minnet igen, det minnet som egentligen är mitt lifs enda, det enda som står när allting annat sjunker undan och blir stoft och ingenting. Och ändå var det så obetydligt, det som skedde. Jag var ute på min morbrors landtställe öfver midsommarhelgen.","My dreams of love - it once seemed to me that they were so close, so close to becoming a reality. Midsummer night, strange pale night, you always wake up that memory again, the memory that is really the only thing in my life, the only thing that stands when everything else sinks away and becomes dust and nothing. And yet it was so insignificant, what happened. I was out at my uncle's country house over the midsummer weekend.","My dreams of love—once it seemed to me that they were so close, so close to coming true.

And yet what happened was so insignificant. I was out at my uncle’s country place for the Midsummer weekend.","My dreams of love—once they seemed to me so close, so very close, to realisation!

"– Min ordination är enkel och klar: den lyder på skilda sofrum. Jag påminner mig att pastorn inte tycker om det, men det kan inte hjälpas. Det är nämligen inte bara själfva den yttersta tillfredsställelsen som i detta fall innebär en stor fara; det är också af vikt att undvika allt som kan egga och hetsa begäret. – Ja, ja, jag vet hvad pastorn vill säga: att ni är en gammal man, och dessutom präst; men jag är ju läkare och kan ha rätt att tala öppet med en patient. Och jag tror inte att jag är alltför ogrannlaga om jag påpekar, att den ständiga närheten till en ung kvinna, på natten till, måste göra ungefär samma verkan på en präst som på en hvar annan man. Jag har ju legat i Uppsala, jag kände rätt många teologer där, och jag fick inte just det intrycket att det teologiska studiet mera än något annat var ägnadt att brandförsäkra unga kroppar mot den sortens eldsvåda. Och hvad åldern beträffar – ja, hur gammal är det pastorn är? – femtisju år; det är en kritisk ålder. I den åldern är begäret sig likt, ungefär som förr – men tillfredsställelsen hämnar sig. Nå, det är sant, det finns så många olika sätt att se på lifvet, och olika sätt att värdera det; och om det vore en gammal vivör jag talade med, skulle jag naturligtvis få vara beredd på det från hans synpunkt ganska logiska svaret: det ger jag tusan, det är ingen mening med att försaka det som ger lifvet värde bara för att få behålla lifvet. Men jag vet ju, att ett sådant sätt att resonnera är helt och hållet främmande för pastorns världsåskådning. Min plikt som läkare är i detta fall att upplysa och att varna – det är allt hvad jag kan göra, och jag är säker om att nu, då pastorn vet att det gäller allvar, är det också allt som behöfs. Jag har svårt att föreställa mig, att det skulle vara i pastorns smak att knall och fall dö samma död som salig kung Fredrik 1, eller nu senast herr Felix Faure ...","- My prescription is simple and clear: it reads in different bedrooms. I remind myself that the pastor does not like it, but it can not be helped. For it is not only the utmost satisfaction itself which in this case entails a great danger; it is also important to avoid anything that may provoke and arouse desire. - Yes, yes, I know what the pastor wants to say: that you are an old man, and also a priest; but I am a doctor and may have the right to speak openly with a patient. And I do not think I am too clumsy if I point out that the constant closeness to a young woman, at night, must have about the same effect on a priest as on any other man. I have been in Uppsala, I knew quite a few theologians there, and I did not get the impression that the theological study was more than anything else suitable for fire insurance young bodies against that kind of fire. And as for age - yes, how old is the pastor? Fifty-seven years; it is a critical age. At that age, the desire is the same, much as before - but the satisfaction takes its toll. Well, it's true, there are so many different ways of looking at life, and different ways of valuing it; and if it were an old vivor I spoke to, I would, of course, be prepared for the, from his point of view, quite logical answer: I give it a thousand, there is no point in renouncing what gives life value just to keep it alive. But I know that such a way of reasoning is completely foreign to the pastor's worldview. My duty as a doctor in this case is to inform and to warn - that's all I can do, and I'm sure that now that the pastor knows it's serious, it's all that is needed. I have a hard time imagining, that it would be in the pastor's taste that the death of the Blessed King Fredrik 1, or most recently Mr. Felix Faure ...","I went on: “My prescription is simple and straightforward: separate bedrooms. I recall that you don’t like that, but it can’t be helped. It’s not just the ultimate satisfaction that is a grave danger in this case; it’s also important to avoid everything that can stir up and excite desire. — Yes, yes, I know what you’re going to say—you’re an old man and a minister to boot— but I’m a physician and have the right to speak openly with a patient, and I don’t think I’m entirely out of order if I point out that the continual proximity of a young woman at night must have more or less the same effect on a minister as on any other man. I’ve studied at Uppsala; I knew many theologians there, and I didn’t get the impression that the study of theology provided any special insurance against that sort of fire. And with regard to age—yes, how old are you, Pastor? Fifty-seven? That’s a critical age: desire is the same as before, but satisfaction has its price. Well, it’s true there are many different ways of looking at life, many different ways of valuing it. If I were talking to an old roué, of course I’d be prepared for an answer that from his point of view would be quite logical : I don’t care—there’s no point in living if you have to give up what makes life meaningful. But naturally I know that this line of reasoning is utterly foreign to your philosophy of life. My duty as a physician in this case is to inform and to warn—that’s all I can do, and I’m certain, now that you know how serious the matter is, that nothing else is needed. I can’t imagine you would choose to drop dead in the same manner as the late King Frederik I, or more recently, Felix Fauré . . .”","—My prescription is clear and simple: it reads ‘separate bedrooms’. I remember you don’t like it, but that can’t be helped. For it isn’t only ultimate satisfaction which, in this case, involves a grave risk; it’s also important to avoid everything which can whet or excite your desires.—Yes, yes, I know what you’re going to say; that you’re an old man, and a clergyman to boot; but after all, I am a doctor, and I’ve the right to speak openly to a patient. And I don’t think I’m exceeding the bounds of what is reasonable if I point out that the constant propinquity of a young woman, particularly at nights, must have much the same effect on a clergyman as on any other mortal man. I’ve studied at Uppsala. I knew many theologians there. And I did not exactly gain the impression that theological studies were more efficient than others as a fire insurance for young bodies against this sort of outbreak. As for age—well, how old are you, sir?—fifty-seven; it’s a critical age. At your age desire is much the same as it ever was,—but satisfaction brings in its revenges. Well, it’s true there are many ways of looking at life, and various ways of evaluating it; and if it was an old rake I was speaking to I should naturally be prepared to hear from him an answer logical enough, seen from his point of view: To the devil with all that! There’s no sense in forsaking the thing which gives life its value, merely in order to retain life itself. But of course I know such a way of reasoning is wholly foreign to your way of thinking, Vicar. My duty as a doctor in this case is to warn and enlighten—this is all I can do, and I am certain , now you know how serious it is, nothing more will prove needful. I find it hard to believe it would be to your taste to drop dead like the late-lamented King Frederick I or, more recently, M. Félix Faure…."

"Då jag såg upp på nytt, såg jag Klas Recke gå förbi åt samma håll. Han nickade i förbigående åt Birck och Markel, kanske också åt mig, det var litet obestämdt. Markel gestikulerade åt honom att slå sig ned hos oss, men han gick förbi utan att låtsas märka det. Han gick i hennes spår. Och jag tyckte mig se en stark hand, som höll dem bägge i en och samma osynliga tråd och drog dem åt ett och samma håll. Och jag frågade mig själf: hvart bär vägen för henne och honom? – Å, hvad kommer det mig vid! Den väg hon går skulle hon ha gått också utan min hjälp. Jag har bara röjt undan litet af den otäckaste smutsen för hennes små fötter. Men hennes väg är för visso tung ändå, det måste den vara. Världen är inte god för dem som älska. Och in i mörkret bär det ju alltid till sist, för dem och för oss alla.","When I looked up again, I saw Klas Recke walk past in the same direction. He nodded in passing to Birck and Markel, perhaps also to me, it was a little indefinite. Markel gestured for him to settle down with us, but he passed by without pretending to notice. He followed in her footsteps. And I seemed to see a strong hand, which held them both in one and the same invisible thread and pulled them in one and the same direction. And I asked myself: where is the way for her and him? - Oh, what does it matter to me! The way she goes she would have gone without my help. I have only cleared away a little of the nastiest dirt for her little feet. But her path is too heavy anyway, it must be. The world is not good for those who love. And into the darkness it always carries in the end, for them and for all of us.","When I looked up again I saw Klas Recke walking by in the same direction. He nodded in passing toward Birck and Markel, perhaps toward me, too—it was somewhat vague. Markel gestured to him to sit down with us, but he pretended not to notice and walked on. He was following in her footsteps. And I thought I could see a strong hand guiding both of them by the same invisible thread, pulling them in the same direction. And I asked myself: where are the two of them headed? — Oh, what difference is it to me? The way she is headed she would have gone even without my help. I’ve merely removed some of the more repellent obstacles in her path. But her way is difficult anyway, it must be. The world isn’t kind to those who love. And into the darkness they’ll go in the end, they and the rest of us.","When I looked up again I saw Klas Recke going by in the same direction.

He was follow-in her footsteps. And I thought I saw a strong hand holding them both, the same invisible string, drawing both of them in the same direction.

Att det skall få finnas sådana människor till i världen som han! Hvem minns inte det gamla problemet, som så ofta kommer under debatt när det sitter några fattiga satar tillsammans vid ett kafébord: om du kunde döda en kinesisk mandarin bara genom att trycka på en knapp i väggen, eller genom en ren viljeakt, och sedan ärfva hans rikedomar – skulle du göra det? Den frågan har jag aldrig gittat svara på, kanske därför att jag aldrig riktigt hårdt och bittert har känt fattigdomens elände.

Då först vill den dö. Ni tror att ni vill dö, därför att allting ser så svårt ut nu. Men ni vill det inte, jag vet att ni inte kan vilja det. Låt tiden gå. Tag dagen som den kommer. Allting kan bli annorlunda förr än ni tror. Också ni själf kan bli annorlunda. Ni är stark och sund; ni kan bli ännu starkare; ni hör till dem som kan växa och förnyas.","- Yes, I said, your body knows it will die once. But it does not want to die; it wants to live. It does not want to die until it is worn out and weighed down by years. Consumed by suffering and burned by lust. Only then does it want to die. You think you want to die, because everything looks so difficult now. But you do not want it, I know you can not want it. Let time pass. Take the day as it comes. Everything can be different sooner than you think. You too can be different. You are strong and healthy; you can become even stronger; you are one of those who can grow and renew.","“Yes,” I said, “your body knows that it will die sometime. But it doesn’t want to die; it wants to live. It doesn’t want to die until it is worn out and weighed down by the years, consumed by suffering and burned up by desire. Only then does it want to die. You think you want this now because everything looks so bleak. But you don’t really ; I know you can’t possibly want this. Let time pass. Take each day as it comes. Everything can be transformed sooner than you think. You yourself can be transformed, too. You’re strong and healthy; you can become even stronger; you are among those who can grow and be renewed.”","—Yes, I said, your body knows it will one day have to die. But it doesn’t want to die; it wants to live. It doesn’t want to die until it’s worn out and burdened with years. Consumed by suffering and burned up by pleasure. Then, and not until then, will it want to die. You think you want to die because everything looks so bleak just now. But you don’t really want it , I know you can’t want it. Let time go by. Take each day as it comes. Sooner than you realise, everything can change completely. You, too, can change. You are strong and healthy; you can be stronger still; you are one of those who can grow and be renewed."

"Vi tego ett ögonblick, så började hon berätta. Han hade väckt henne midt i natten. Han hade inte kunnat somna. Han tiggde och bad; han grät. Han talade om att hans salighet stod på spel, han visste inte hvilka svåra synder han kunde komma att begå, om hon inte gjorde honom till viljes. Det var hennes plikt att göra det, och plikten gick före hälsan. Gud skulle hjälpa dem, Gud skulle göra henne frisk i alla fall.","We paused for a moment, then she began to tell. He had woken her in the middle of the night. He had not been able to fall asleep. He begged and prayed; he cried.

God would help them, God would make her healthy anyway.","We were silent for a moment; then she told the story. He’d awakened her in the middle of the night. He hadn’t been able to sleep.

"Det sista kom så förbluffande att jag satt svarslös. Ända tills jag hörde honom nämna mitt namn trodde jag att han talade om sig själf. Jag tror det ännu, och att det var för att dölja det som han slog ner på mig. Det blef en tryckande tystnad. Jag såg ut öfver glittret på strömmen. I skymassorna öfver Rosenbad öppnades en ljus månbristning, och det föll ett blekt silfver öfver det gamla Bondeska husets pelarfasad. Ute öfver Mälaren seglade långsamt ett rödviolett moln för sig själf, lösryckt från de andra.","The last one came so astonishingly that I sat unanswered. Until I heard him mention my name, I thought he was talking about himself. I still believe it, and that it was to hide what he hit me. There was an oppressive silence. I looked out over the glitter of the stream. In the clouds over Rosenbad, a light moon burst opened, and a pale silver fell over the pillar façade of the old Peasant House. Out over Lake Mälaren, a red-violet cloud slowly sailed for itself, detached from the others.","His last comment was so startling that I was speechless. Until the moment I heard him say my name I thought he was talking about himself. I still do think that, and that it was to disguise this that he pounced on me. There was an oppressive silence. I looked at the lights reflected in the Stream. In the cloud banks above Rosenbad the moon broke through, and its pale silver light illuminated the colonnade of the Bonde family’s ancient palace. Out above Lake Mälaren a purple cloud sailed slowly by itself, separated from the others.","This last astounded me. I just sat there, without a word to reply. Right up to the moment I heard my own name uttered I thought he was speaking of himself. And I still think so. It was simply in order to conceal it that he pounced upon me. An oppressive silence followed. I looked out over the glittering waters of The Stream. In the cloud-masses over Rosenbad the moonlight broke through, and a pale silvery light fell on the pillared façade of the old palace of the Bonde family. Over the Mälaren lakes a violet red cloud sailed on its solitary way, detached from the others. 1 Swedish ‘lyckan’= happiness, ‘lyktan’ ="

Bror Ernst, som var så stark och så dum och så snäll, min hjälp och mitt beskydd i alla skolpojkslifvets äfventyrligheter – borta. Till Australien for han, och ingen vet om han lefver eller är död. Och min vackra kusin Alice, som stod så blek och rak vid pianot och sjöng med en sömngångerskas ögon och med en röst som skimrade och brann, sjöng så att jag skakades af frossa där jag satt hopkrupen i en vrå af den stora glasverandan, sjöng så som jag aldrig får höra någon sjunga mer, hvad blef det af henne?

"Jag kom alltså till Djurgårdsbrunn och fick ett bord vid glasväggen i den låga paviljongen. Kyparen skyndade fram med matsedeln och bredde diskret en ren servet öfver de rester af kalfstekssås och Battys senap som ett tidigare middagssällskap lämnat kvar, och då han i nästa ögonblick räckte mig vinlistan röjde han med den korta, hastigt framkastade frågan: Chablis? att hans minne rymde kanske lika omätliga fonder af detaljkunskaper som mången professors. Jag är ingen flitig källarkund, men det är sant att jag nästan aldrig dricker något annat vin än chablis, när jag då och då äter middag ute. Och han var gammal i facket och kände sina pappenheimare. Den första ungdomsyran hade han stillat med att balansera punschbrickor i Berns, med en mognare ålders allvar hade han fyllt mera invecklade plikter som matsalskypare på Rydberg och Hamburger börs, och hvem vet hvilken tillfällig ogunst af ödet som var skuld till att han nu med glesnande hjässa och litet flottigare frack verkade i sitt kall på ett något enklare ställe. Han hade med åren fått en prägel af att höra hemma öfverallt, där det luktar mat och korkas upp buteljer. Det gladde mig att se honom, och vi växlade en blick af hemligt förstånd.","So I came to Djurgårdsbrunn and got a table by the glass wall in the low pavilion. The waiter hurried forward with the menu and discreetly spread a clean napkin over the remnants of veal roast sauce and Batty's mustard left over by a previous dinner party, and when he handed me the wine list the next moment, he cleared the short, hasty question: Chablis? that his memory contained perhaps as immeasurable funds of detailed knowledge as many professors. I'm not a diligent cellar customer, but it's true that I almost never drink any wine other than chablis, when I occasionally have dinner out. And he was old in the union and knew his Pappenheimers. He had stopped the first youth acid by balancing punch trays in Berns, with the seriousness of a more mature age he had fulfilled more complicated duties as a dining room waiter on the Rydberg and Hamburger stock exchanges, and who knows what temporary disfavor of fate was due to him now with sparse head and a slightly nicer evening dress seemed in its cold in a slightly simpler place. Over the years, he had acquired a touch of belonging everywhere, where it smells like food and bottles are corked. I was glad to see him, and we exchanged a look of secret understanding.","I came to Djurgårdsbrunn Inn and found a table by the glass wall in the low pavilion. The waiter hurried over with the menu and discretely spread a clean tablecloth over the remains of veal gravy and Batty’s mustard that a previous dinner party had left behind. By immediately handing me the wine list and tossing out the quick, brief question, “Chablis?” he revealed that his memory contained a vast store of detailed knowledge to rival that of many a professor. I’m not a frequent restaurant guest, but it’s true that chablis is almost always the wine I drink when I do eat out. And he was an old pro who knew his clientele. He’d worn down his initial youthful enthusiasm balancing trays of liquor at Bern’s Lounge; at a more serious, mature age he’d fulfilled more complicated duties as a dining room waiter at Rydberg’s Restaurant and Hamburger Börs, and who knows what temporary ill turn of fate had brought him now, with thinning hair and stained jacket, to a somewhat simpler place. Over the years he’d acquired an aura of belonging anywhere that food is served and bottles are uncorked. I was pleased to see him, and we exchanged a glance of secret understanding.","So I arrived at Djurgårdsbrunn and found a table by the glass wall in the long pavilion. The waiter hurried forward with the menu and discreetly spread a clean white napkin over the remains of gravy and Batty’s mustard left by an earlier party. The next moment, handing me the wine list, he disclosed by his hasty ‘Chablis’? a memory containing, it may be, depths of knowledge immeasurable as many a professor’s. No regular winebibber, it is true that when dining out I never drink any other wine but Chablis. And he was an old hand who knew his man. His first youthful frenzies he had stilled balancing punch trays at Berns, afterwards with the seriousness of riper years fulfilling the more involved duties of dining-room waiter at Rydberg and Hamburger Bärs. Who knows what transient rejection at destiny’s hands was now responsible for him—hair thinning and evening dress a trifle frayed—labouring at his calling in this somewhat humbler place? The years had lent him an air of belonging wherever there is a smell of food and bottles to be uncorked. I was pleased to see him, and we exchanged a glance of secret understanding."
"– Nej, ingenting af allt detta, sade hon. Det skedde så besynnerligt, det var ingenting sådant som ni kan gissa er till eller förstå af er själf. Jag var naturligtvis aldrig kär i honom, aldrig det ringaste. Inte ens den vanliga flickförtjusningen för konfirmationsprästen – ingenting alls. Men jag skall försöka berätta och förklara alltsammans för er.","""No, none of this,"" she said. It happened so strangely, it was nothing like that you can guess or understand by yourself.

"Så fladdrade mina tankar som spräckliga fjärilar, medan ceremonien led mot sitt slut. Kyrkans portar slogos upp, man trängdes mot utgången under klockornas dån, kistan vacklade och gungade som ett skepp i porthvalfvet, och en frisk höstvind slog emot mig. Ute var det en gråblandad himmel och en tunn blek sol. Jag kände mig själf litet gråblandad och tunn och blek, som man blir af att sitta länge inklämd i en kyrka, isynnerhet när det är begrafning eller nattvardsgång. Jag gick till badhuset vid Malmtorgsgatan för att få en finsk badstu.","Then my thoughts fluttered like speckled butterflies, as the ceremony came to an end. The gates of the church were opened, the exit was pressed under the roar of the bells, the coffin staggered and swayed like a ship in the vault of the gate, and a fresh autumn wind struck me. Outside it was a gray sky and a thin pale sun. I felt a little gray-mixed and thin and pale, as one gets from sitting for a long time trapped in a church, especially when it is a funeral or communion. I went to the bathhouse at Malmtorgsgatan to get a Finnish sauna.","And so my thoughts flitted about like speckled butterflies while the ceremony drew to a close. The doors of the church were opened, people surged toward the entrance while the bells pealed, the coffin shook and pitched like a ship as it was carried out, and an autumn wind blew into my face. Outside the sky was mostly gray, with a weak, pale sun. I myself felt somewhat gray and weak and pale, the way you do from sitting cooped up so long in a church, especially for a funeral or communion service. I went to the bath house at Malmtorg Street to take a Finnish sauna.","So, as the ceremony moved to an end, my thoughts like butterflies fluttered about me. The church doors were thrown open, people jostled at the exit under a din of bells, and under the portals the coffin staggered and swayed like a ship at sea, and a fresh autumn breeze struck me. Outside, a greyish sky and thin pale sunshine. I, too, felt greyish, thin, and pale, as one does after sitting a long while squeezed inside a church, particularly at a funeral or holy communion. I went to the bath house in Malmtorgsgatan, to take a Finnish bath."

"Blåsten ruskar om i träden på kyrkogården, och regnet skvalar i takrännan. En fattig slusk med en butelj i fickan har sökt skydd under kyrktaket, i en vrå invid en sträfpelare. Han står stödd mot den röda kyrkomuren, och hans blick irrar from och blå bland de drifvande molnen. Det dryper af de två magra träden vid Bellmans graf. Snedt öfver kyrkogårdshörnet ligger ett beryktadt hus; en flicka i lintyget tassar fram till ett fönster och rullar ner gardinen.","The wind shakes the trees in the cemetery, and the rain falls in the gutter. A poor slut with a bottle in his pocket has sought refuge under the church roof, in a corner next to a buttress.

"Men det är också en annan sak som är lika viktig som hafvet; jag vill ha rik grönska och stora susande träd. Inga tallar och granar. Ja, tallarna gå ändå an, när de äro höga och raka och starka och ha lyckats bli hvad de äro ämnade till; men den naggade konturen af en granskog mot himlen pinar mig på ett sätt som jag inte kan förklara. Dessutom regnar det ju ibland på landet som i staden, och en granskog i regnväder gör mig alldeles sjuk och eländig. Nej, det skall vara en arkadisk ängd med långsam sluttning ned mot stranden och grupper af stora bladrika träd, som slå gröna hvalf öfver mitt hufvud.","But there is another thing that is as important as the ocean; I want rich greenery and big rustling trees. No pines and spruces. Yes, the pines still work when they are tall and straight and strong and have managed to become what they are meant for; but the nibbled contour of a spruce forest against the sky torments me in a way I can not explain. In addition, it sometimes rains in the country as in the city, and a spruce forest in rainy weather makes me really sick and miserable. No, it must be an arcade meadow with a slow slope down to the shore and groups of large leafy trees beating green vaults over my head.","But there’s another thing, too, that’s just as important as the sea: I want rich vegetation and enormous, swaying trees.

No, it should be an Arcadian meadow sloping gently down to the shore with stands of large, leafy trees that make green arches over my head.","But there is one more thing, as important as the sea; I want to have a wealth of greenery and great sighing trees.

"Plötsligt fick jag en ingifvelse. Eftersom det ändå måste ske: – hvarför inte här? Hvarför inte nu? Jag såg mig omkring, Det fanns ingen i närheten just nu. Vid ett bord långt borta sutto tre gamla herrar, af hvilka jag kände en, en pensionerad gammal ryttmästare; men de pratade högt med hvarandra och talade om historier och skrattade och kunde icke höra hvad vi sade eller se hvad vi gjorde. En liten smutsig och barfota flickunge tassade fram till oss och bjöd ut blommor, vi skakade på hufvudena, och hon försvann lika tyst. Framför oss låg torgets sandplan nästan tom i den sena middagstimmen. Från hörnet vid kyrkan sneddade då och då en fotgängare ned mot östra alléen. En varm sensommarsol förgyllde Dramatiska teaterns gamla gula fasad mellan lindarna. På trottoaren stod teaterns direktör och pratade med regissören. Afståndet gjorde dem till miniatyrer, hvilkas linjespel blott ett öga som kände dem förut kunde uppfatta och tolka. Regissören röjdes af sin röda fez, som blef till en liten gnista i solen, direktören af dessa delikata handrörelser som tycktes säga: ja, herregud, hvar sak har två sidor! Jag kände mig öfvertygad om att det var något i den vägen han sade, jag såg den lätta axelryckningen, jag tyckte mig höra tonfallet. Och jag tillämpade orden på mig och mitt. Ja, hvar sak har två sidor. Men man må aldrig så väl ha ögonen öppna för dem bägge, man måste dock till sist välja den ena. Och jag hade för längesedan gjort mitt val.","Suddenly I got an inspiration. Because it still has to happen: - why not here? Why not now? I looked around, there was no one nearby right now. At a table far away sat three old gentlemen, one of whom I knew, a retired old horseman; but they talked loudly to each other and told stories and laughed and could not hear what we were saying or see what we were doing. A little dirty and barefoot girl pawed at us and offered flowers, we shook our heads, and she disappeared just as quietly. In front of us, the square's sand level was almost empty in the late afternoon hours. From the corner of the church, a pedestrian occasionally slanted down to the eastern avenue. A warm late summer sun gilded the Dramatic Theater's old yellow facade between the lindens. The theater director stood on the sidewalk, talking to the director. The distance made them miniatures, whose line play only an eye that knew them before could perceive and interpret. The director was cleared by his red fez, which turned into a little spark in the sun, the director of these delicate hand movements that seemed to say: yes, my God, every thing has two sides! I felt convinced that there was something in the way he said, I saw the slight shrug, I seemed to hear the tone. And I applied the words to myself and mine. Yes, each thing has two sides. But you must never so well have your eyes open for both of them, but you must finally choose one. And I had made my choice a long time ago.","Suddenly I had an inspiration. Since it had to happen anyway—why not here? Why not now? I looked around. No one was nearby at the moment. At a table far away three old gentlemen were sitting, one of whom, a retired captain, I knew, but they were conversing in loud voices, telling stories and laughing, and couldn’t hear what we said or see what we did. A little girl, dirty and barefoot, padded over to us selling flowers; we shook our heads and she vanished just as quietly. In front of us the expanse of gravel of the square was nearly empty at this late-afternoon hour. Every now and then, from the corner by the church, a pedestrian would cut across toward the avenue of trees to the east. A warm, late-summer sun made the worn yellow façade of the Royal Dramatic Theater seem golden through the lindens. The chief administrator of the theater was standing on the sidewalk talking to the director. In the distance they seemed like miniatures whose movements could be discerned and deciphered only if one knew who they were. The director was distinguished by his red fez, the administrator by his subtle hand gestures, which seemed to convey, “Good heavens, every matter has two sides!” I was convinced he was saying something like that: I could see the slight shrug of the shoulders, I thought I could hear the tone of voice. And I applied the words to myself and the present situation. Yes, every matter has two sides. But no matter how much a person is open to both possibilities, in the end only one can be chosen. And I’d made my choice long ago.","Suddenly I had an inspiration. Since it had got to happen,—why not here? I looked about me. No one was near us just then. At a table far away sat three old gentlemen, one of whom, a retired cavalry captain, was known to me; but they were talking loudly together, telling tales and laughing, and so were not able to hear what we said or did. A dirty little barefoot girl came padding up to us, proffering us flowers. We shook our heads and she silently vanished. Before us spread the gravel spaces of the square, almost empty at this late afternoon hour. Now and then, from the corner by the church, a pedestrian would take a short-cut down to the eastern avenue. A warm late summer sun gilded the Dramatic Theatre’s old yellow façade between the linden trees. On the pavement the manager of the theatre was standing talking to the producer. The distance reduced them to miniatures, the play of their outlines only to be grasped and interpreted by an eye already familiar with them. The producer was betrayed by his red fez, which gleamed like a little spark in the sunshine, and the manager by those delicate movements of his hands which seemed to say: Well, damn it all, there are two sides to everything! I felt sure he was saying something of the sort. I saw the slight shrug of his shoulders, even seemed to hear his tone of voice. And I applied the words to my own affairs. Yes, there are two sides to everything. But no matter how wide you open your eyes to both of them, in the end you are obliged to choose only one. And I had long ago made my choice."
"Därute hänger den stora blå natten öfver kyrkogårdens träd. Det är tyst i staden nu, så tyst att suckarna och hviskningarna från skuggorna där nere tränga ända hit upp, och en enstaka gång skär ett fräckt skratt igenom.

"Jag mötte dem nyss, på min kvällspromenad. Jag gick utan mål genom gatorna i den varma rosenskymningen, gick och tänkte på henne, den lilla kvinnan. Jag tänker ofta på henne. Jag kom in på en tom och afsides gata – där såg jag dem plötsligt komma emot mig. De kommo ut ur en port. Jag drog hastigt upp näsduken och snöt mig för att dölja mitt ansikte. Det var för resten onödigt; han känner visst knappt igen mig, och hon såg mig icke, hon var blind af lycka.","I just met them, on my evening walk. I walked aimlessly through the streets in the warm twilight of the roses, walking and thinking of her, the little woman. I often think of her. I entered an empty and secluded street - there I suddenly saw them coming towards me. They came out of a gate. I quickly pulled up the handkerchief and sniffed to hide my face. It was, after all, unnecessary; he must hardly recognize me, and she did not see me, she was blind to happiness.","I just ran into them on my after-dinner walk. I was wandering at random down the streets in the warm, rosy twilight, thinking about her, the young woman. I think about her often. I turned off on an empty side street—and there all of a sudden I saw them approaching. They had just stepped out of a building. I quickly pulled out my handkerchief and blew my nose to hide my face. This was quite unnecessary; he scarcely knows who I am, and she, blinded by happiness, didn’t see me at all.","I met them only a little while ago, as I was taking my evening stroll at random through the streets in the warm rose-tinted twilight.

Hastily, to hide my face, I pulled out my handkerchief and blew my nose. It was hardly necessary. He, I am sure, scarcely knows me by sight; and she, blind with happiness, did not see me."
"Hennes fall var dock ett af dem, där jag kände mig säker. Om jag också inte trodde på »plikten» – inte trodde att den var den öfver allt annat bindande lag, som den gaf sig ut för att vara – så stod det dock alldeles klart för mig att det rätta och kloka i detta fall var att göra det, som de andra kalla plikten. Och jag gjorde det utan tvekan.","Her case, however, was one of those where I felt safe. If I also did not believe in the ""duty"" - did not believe that it was above all other binding law, as it pretended to be - then it was quite clear to me that the right and wise thing to do in this case that, which the others call duty. And I did it without a doubt.","Still, her case was one of those I was sure about. Even though I didn’t believe in duty, didn’t believe it was the overriding law, above all others, that it claimed to be, it was still completely clear to me that the correct and wise course in this case was to do what others called my duty.

"Jag tog upp urboetten med pillerna ur västfickan, tog ett piller mellan tummen och pekfingret, vände mig litet åt sidan och låtsades taga in det.

"Officianten utgick från Syrachs ord: »Från morgon till afton kan mycket ändra sig, och Herren kan allting med hast förvandla.» Han gäller för att vara ett världens barn. Och det är sant att jag ofta har sett hans blanka kranium lysa på teatrarnas parkett och hans hvita händer forma sig till diskreta applåder. Men han är en framstående andlig vältalare, och han var tydligen själf djupt gripen af de gamla orden, som i oöfverskådliga släktled ha ljudit vid oförmodade dödsfall och hastigt öppnade grafvar och som ge ett så skakande uttryck åt människobarnens bäfvan under den okända handen som skuggar öfver deras värld och lika gåtfullt sänder dem dag och natt och lif och död. »Stillastående och förblifvande är oss icke gifvet», sade prästen. »Det vore oss icke nyttigt, icke möjligt, icke ens uthärdligt. Förvandlingens lag är icke blott dödens: den är först och främst lifvets lag. Och likväl stå vi hvar gång på nytt lika öfverraskade och gripna af rysning inför förvandlingen, när vi se den så plötsligt fullbordad och så annorlunda än vi hade tänkt ... Det borde icke så vara, mina bröder. Vi borde tänka: Herren visste att frukten var mogen, fast det icke syntes så för oss, och lät den falla i sin hand» ... Jag kände mina ögon fuktas och dolde min rörelse i hatten. Jag glömde i denna stund nästan bort hvad jag visste om orsaken till att frukten så hastigt hade mognat och fallit af ... Eller rättare: jag kände att jag i grunden icke visste mera därom än någon annan. Jag visste blott litet om de närmaste anledningarna och omständigheterna, men bakom dem förlorade sig den långa orsakskedjan i dunklet. Jag kände min »handling» som länk i en kedja, som våg i en rörelse; en kedja och en rörelse, som hade begynt långt före min första tanke och långt före den dag, då min far första gången såg med begärelse på min mor. Jag kände nödvändighetens lag: kände den rent kroppsligt som en ilning genom märg och ben. Jag kände ingen skuld. Det finns ingen skuld. Den rysning jag kände var densamma som jag stundom får af mycket stor och allvarsam musik eller mycket ensamma och ljusa tankar.","The official proceeded from the words of Syracuse: ""From morning to evening much can change, and the Lord can quickly change everything."" He is considered to be a child of the world. And it is true that I have often seen his shiny skull shine on the theaters' parquet and his white hands form into discreet applause. But he is a distinguished spiritual orator, and he was apparently himself deeply moved by the old words, which in incomprehensible generations have sounded at unexpected deaths and hastily opened graves, and which give such a shaky expression to the trembling of human children under the unknown hand that casts shadows over their world and just as enigmatically sends them day and night and life and death. ""Stagnant and abiding are not given to us,"" said the priest. ""It would not be useful to us, not possible, not even bearable. The law of transformation is not only the law of death: it is first and foremost the law of life. And yet we stand again and again just as surprised and seized with trembling before the transformation, when we see it so suddenly completed and so different than we had thought ... It should not be so, my brothers. We should think: The Lord knew that the fruit was ripe, although it did not seem so to us, and let it fall into his hand »... I felt my eyes moistened and hid my movement in the hat. At that moment I almost forgot what I knew about the reason why the fruit had ripened so quickly and fallen off ... Or rather: I felt that I basically did not know more about it than anyone else. I knew little about the immediate causes and circumstances, but behind them the long chain of causes was lost in the obscurity. I felt my ""action"" as a link in a chain, as a wave in a movement; a chain and a movement, which had begun long before my first thought and long before the day when my father first looked with desire at my mother. I knew the law of necessity: it felt purely bodily like a rash through the marrow and bones. I felt no guilt. There is no guilt. The shiver I felt was the same that I sometimes get from very big and serious music or very lonely and bright thoughts.","The officiator drew on Syrak’s words: “From morning until evening the time changeth, and all things are speedy before the Lord.” He’s considered a man of the world, and it’s true I’ve often seen his gleaming pate in the best seats of the theater, his white hands discretely lifted in applause. But he’s a celebrated preacher, known for his eloquence, and clearly he himself was deeply moved by the ancient words that through untold generations have been uttered at untimely deaths and hastily opened graves and that are such a harrowing expression of human beings’ dread of the unknown hand that casts a shadow over their world and enigmatically brings them day and night and life and death. “Inertia and immutability are not granted unto us,” said the minister. “That would not serve us well; it would not be possible, not even endurable. The law of change is not merely that of death: it is first and foremost the law of life. And nevertheless each time we are faced by change, we are just as taken aback and shudder just as deeply when we see it so suddenly manifest and so at odds with what we had imagined . . . It should not be so, my brothers. We should think: The Lord knew that the fruit was ripe, though it did not appear so to us, and let it fall into His hand . . .” I felt my eyes grow moist and buried my face in my hat to conceal my emotion. At that moment I nearly forgot what I knew about why the fruit had so hastily ripened and fallen . . . Or more precisely: I felt that deep down, I knew no more about this than anyone else. I merely had some familiarity with the most immediate reasons and circumstances, but beyond them the long chain of cause and effect vanished into oblivion. I felt that my “action” was a link in a chain, a surge of a wave, a link and a surge that had begun long before my first conscious thought and long before the day my father first looked with desire at my mother. I could feel the law of necessity, feel it physically, like a shiver in the marrow of my bones. I felt no guilt. There is no guilt. The shiver was the same sensation I sometimes feel from solemn, majestic music or solitary, elevated thoughts.","The officiating clergyman spoke on Syrak’s words: “From morning until evening the time changeth and all things are speedy before the Lord.” He has the reputation of being a child of this world. And it’s true I’ve often seen his pate gleaming in the stalls of theatres, and his white hands forming themselves into discreet applause. But he is a prominent rhetorician of the spirit, and it was clear that he, too, was deeply moved by the old words which through inconceivable generations have rung out on occasions of sudden death and hastily opened graves, and which so vividly express the terror felt by the children of men under the unknown hand that casts its shadow over their world, as enigmatically sending them day as night, and life and death. “Immobility, permanence are not given unto us,” the clergyman was saying. “It would not be good for us, not possible for us, no, nor even bearable. The law of change belongs not only to death: first and foremost it is the law of life. Yet again we stand here, no less amazed, no less shuddering at change, when suddenly we see it accomplished, and in a way so different from anything we had ever expected…. It should not be so, my brethren. We should reflect: The Lord knew the fruit was ripe, although to us it did not seem so, and He has let it fall into His hand….” I felt my eyes becoming moist, and hid my emotion in my hat. At that moment I almost forgot what I knew of the reasons why the fruit had so hastily ripened and fallen … or, to be more exact, I felt at root I knew no more about it than anyone else did. All I knew were a few of the most immediate reasons and circumstances, but behind these the long chain of causation lost itself in darkness. I felt my ‘action’ to be a link in a chain, a wave in a greater movement; a chain and a movement which had had their beginning long before my first thought, long before the day when my father first looked with desire upon my mother. I felt the law of necessity: felt it bodily, as a shiver passing through marrow and bone. I felt no guilt. There is no guilt. The shiver I felt was the same as I sometimes feel from great and serious music, or very solitary and elevated thoughts."

"Markel vände sig till mig och frågade vänligt om jag ville slå mig ner i en utvald krets af gamla alkoholister. Jag tackade och svarade, att jag strax skulle gå hem. Det var också min mening, men jag kände i verkligheten ingen längtan efter mina ensamma rum, jag satt ännu länge kvar och lyssnade till musiken från Strömparterren, som tydlig och stark trängde fram genom den kvällstysta staden, och jag såg hur slottet speglade sina blinda och stirrande fönsterrader i strömmen – ty det är ingen ström just nu, den ligger blank som en skogstjärn. Och jag såg på en liten blå stjärna som stod och darrade öfver Rosenbad. Jag hörde också på samtalet vid bordet bredvid. De talade om kvinnorna och om kärleken, och frågan gällde, hvad som är den viktigaste förutsättningen för att man skall kunna ha riktigt roligt med en kvinna.","Markel turned to me and kindly asked if I wanted to sit in a select circle of old alcoholics. I thanked and replied that I would go home soon. That was also my opinion, but in reality I felt no longing for my lonely rooms, I sat still for a long time and listened to the music from Strömparterren, which clearly and strongly penetrated through the evening-quiet city, and I saw how the castle reflected its blind and staring window rows in the stream - for there is no stream right now, it is shining like a forest star. And I looked at a little blue star that was shaking over Rosenbad. I also heard the conversation at the table next to me. They talked about women and about love, and the question was, what is the most important prerequisite for being able to have real fun with a woman.","Markel turned toward me and inquired amiably if I’d like to join this select group of old alcoholics. I said no thanks, I was on my way home. That was my intention, but I really didn’t feel any longing for my solitary rooms, so I stayed a little while longer listening to the music from the Stream Terrace, which cut loud and clear through the evening silence, and watching the reflection of the blind, staring windows of the palace in the Stream—for right now it’s no stream, it’s smooth as a forest lake. I could see a tiny blue star twinkling above Rosenbad, the ministry building. I could hear the conversation at the next table, too. They were talking about women and love, debating what the most important condition was for really enjoying yourself with a woman.","Markel turned to me and asked me if I would care to join this select circle of dipsomaniacs. I thanked him, but replied that I was shortly going home. And such was my intention, although in reality I felt no longing for my solitary room, and sat on a long while more, listening to the music from the Strömparterren as it penetrated clear and loud through the dusky silence of the town and looking across to where the Palace mirrored its blind staring windows in the waters of The Stream—a stream which just then was no stream, but lay glassy as a forest pool. And I looked at a little blue star which stood shivering over Rosenbad. I listened, too, to the conversation at the neighbouring table. They were talking of women and love, the question being: what is the cardinal condition for a man to enjoy himself thoroughly with a woman?"
"En kvinna kom till mig i sin nöd, och jag lofvade att hjälpa henne. Hjälpa, ja – hvad det betydde eller kunde komma att betyda hade ju ingen af oss tänkt sig in i då. Det som hon begärde af mig var ju så enkelt och lätt. Det kostade mig hvarken möda eller betänkligheter, det hela roade mig snarast, jag gjorde den vackra unga kvinnan en delikat tjänst på samma gång som jag spelade den vidriga prästen ett elakt spratt, och i min tjocka svartgråa spleen kom denna episod och lyste upp som en rosengnista från en värld, stängd för mig ... Och för henne betydde det ju lyckan och lifvet – så, som hon såg det och som hon fick mig att se det. Så lofvade jag då att hjälpa henne, och gjorde det – det som skulle göras då.","A woman came to me in her distress, and I promised to help her.

And for her it meant happiness and life—as she saw it, and as she made me see it.

"Ofta går jag ett slag ut på Skeppsholmen, bara därför att det var där jag talade med henne sist. I kväll stod jag på höjden vid kyrkan och såg solen gå ner. Det slog mig hur vackert Stockholm är.

"Rosorna – ja, det var nu också en historia. Det första jag såg då jag kom ut i salen i morse var ett visitkort som låg på spegelbordet bredvid blomglaset: Eva Mertens. Jag förstår ännu i denna stund inte hur jag kunde undgå att se det i går. Och hur ända längst bort i andra ändan af helvete har den goda, söta flickan kunnat falla på den idén att skicka blommor till mig ovärdige syndare? Den djupare orsaken kan jag visserligen med ansträngande af mitt skarpsinne och med öfvervinnande af min blygsamhet gissa mig till; men anledningen? Förevändningen? Hur jag grubblar, kan jag inte tänka ut någon annan förklaring än denna: Hon har läst eller hört talas om hur jag råkade vara närvarande vid det sorgliga dödsfallet; hon antar att jag är djupt uppskakad och har därför velat sända mig detta bevis på sin sympati. Hon har handlat plötsligt och impulsivt och så som det föll sig naturligt för henne. Det är ett godt hjärta på den flickan ...","The roses - yes, that was a story now too.

And how, at the very far end of the other end of hell, has the good, sweet girl been able to come up with the idea of sending flowers to me unworthy sinners? The deeper cause I can certainly guess at with the exertion of my acumen and with the overcoming of my modesty; but the reason? The pretext? How I ponder, I can think of no other explanation than this: She has read or heard of how I happened to be present at the tragic death; she assumes that I am deeply shaken and has therefore wanted to send me this proof of her sympathy. She has acted suddenly and impulsively and as it seemed natural to her. It's a good heart on that girl ...","The roses—yes, that was quite a tale, too.

"Birck: Ja visst. På det sättet är det själfklart. Och ditt svar erinrar mig för hundrade gången om att all filosofi lefver och har sin näring uteslutande af språkliga tvetydigheter. Mot den vulgära lyckopannkakan sätter den ena sin frälsningskrokan och den andra »sitt verk»; och bägge förneka all bekantskap med något som helst sträfvande efter lycka. Det är en afundsvärd gåfva att på det sättet kunna bedraga sig själf med ord. Man har ju alltid ett begär att se sig själf och sin sträfvan i ett ljus af idealitet. Och den djupaste lyckan ligger kanske till sist i den illusionen, att man icke traktar efter lycka.","Birck: Yes, of course. That way, it goes without saying. And your answer reminds me for the hundredth time that all philosophy lives and feeds exclusively on linguistic ambiguities. Against the vulgar happiness pancake, one puts his salvation hook and the other ""his work""; and both deny all acquaintance with any striving for happiness. It is an enviable gift to be able to deceive oneself with words in that way. You always have a desire to see yourself and your striving in a light of ideality. And perhaps the deepest happiness lies ultimately in the illusion that one does not seek happiness.","Birck: “Of course. In that sense it’s self-evident. And your answer reminds me for the hundredth time that all philosophy derives from and is sustained by verbal sophistry. Instead of some vulgar notion of happiness, one person cites religion, the other his ‘life’s work,’ and both of them deny that they are ever, in any way, looking for happiness. It’s an enviable talent to be able to delude yourself with words that way. We all have the desire to see ourselves and our aspirations in an idealistic light. And perhaps in the end the deepest happiness is the illusion that we’re not looking for happiness.”","BIRCK: Of course. In that way it’s self-evident. And your answer reminds me for the hundredth time that all philosophy lives by, and wholly feeds on, verbal ambiguities.

An enviable gift this, of being able to deceive oneself with words. Haven’t we all, always, a need to see ourselves and our efforts in the light of a certain ideality? Perhaps then in the last resort the deepest happiness lies in the illusion of not desiring happiness."

"Jag har visst redan sagt er, att jag var mycket religiöst uppfostrad. Nu sjönk jag alldeles ner i religionen, jag blef sjuksköterskeelev, men måste sluta därför att min hälsa hade blifvit klen; så var jag åter hemma, gick i mina sysslor där i hemmet som förut och drömde och längtade och bad Gud befria mig från mina drömmar och min längtan. Jag kände att det som var var outhärdligt, att en förändring måste ske. Så en dag fick jag veta af far, att pastor Gregorius hade begärt mig till hustru. Jag stod alldeles häpen, han hade aldrig närmat sig till mig på något sådant sätt att jag kunnat ana något. Han hade umgåtts länge hos oss, mor beundrade honom, och far var lite rädd för honom, tror jag. Jag gick in i mitt rum och grät. Det var alltid något hos honom som bjöd mig emot på ett särskildt sätt, och jag tror att det just var detta som gjorde att jag till sist bestämde mig för att säga ja. Ingen lade något tvång på mig, ingen öfvertalade mig. Men jag trodde att det var Guds vilja. Man hade ju lärt mig att tro, att Guds vilja alltid var det, som allra mest bjöd vår egen vilja emot. Ännu natten förut hade jag ju legat vaken och bedt till Gud om befrielse och ro. Jag trodde nu, att han hade hört mina böner – på sitt sätt. Jag tyckte mig se hans vilja lysa alldeles klart för mina ögon. Jag trodde, att vid den mannens sida skulle min längtan slockna och mina begär dö bort, och att det var på det sättet Gud hade ordnat det för mig. Och att han var en god och bra man var jag ju säker på, eftersom han var präst.","I have probably already told you that I was brought up very religiously. Now I was completely immersed in religion, I became a nursing student, but had to quit because my health had become poor; so I was home again, went in my chores there at home as before and dreamed and longed and asked God to free me from my dreams and my longing. I felt that what was was unbearable, that a change had to happen. So one day I learned from my father that Pastor Gregorius had asked me to be my wife. I was completely amazed, he had never approached me in such a way that I could guess anything. He had spent a lot of time with us, mother admired him, and father was a little afraid of him, I think. I went into my room and cried. There was always something about him that invited me in a special way, and I think that was exactly what made me finally decide to say yes. No one forced me, no one persuaded me. But I thought it was God's will. I had been taught to believe that God's will was always the one that most opposed our own will. Even the night before, I had been awake and prayed to God for deliverance and peace. I thought now that he had heard my prayers - in his own way. I thought I saw his will shining very clearly before my eyes. I thought that by that man's side my longing would die out and my desires would die away, and that was the way God had arranged it for me. And that he was a good and good man, I was sure, because he was a priest.","“I think I told you before that I had a strict religious upbringing. Now I fell back entirely on religion; I started studying nursing, but had to give it up when my health began to fail. After that I went home again, went about my household tasks as before, dreaming and longing and praying God to spare me these dreams and this longing. I felt the situation was unbearable and that something had to change. Then one day my father told me that Pastor Gregorius had asked for me in marriage. I was totally taken aback—his behavior toward me had never led me to imagine anything like that. He’d been a friend of the family for a long time; Mother admired him, and Father was a bit afraid of him, I think. I went into my room and wept. There had always been something about him that I found particularly unappealing, and I think that was exactly what made me decide to say yes. No one forced me, no one talked me around. But I believed it was God’s will. After all, I’d been taught that God’s will was always whatever we wanted the least. Just the night before I’d been lying awake praying to God for release and peace of mind, and now I thought He’d heard my prayers—in His own way. It seemed to me I could see His will quite clearly before my eyes. At that man’s side, I thought, my longing would vanish and my desire die away, and this was what God had ordained for me. And I was sure he was a kind and good man—after all, he was a minister.","I’ve told you already, haven’t I, that I was very religiously brought up. Now I sank wholly into religion. I began training to be a nurse, but had to give it up because my health had begun to fail. So I came home again, did odd jobs about the house as before, and dreamed and had longings and prayed to God to free me from my dreams and my longings. I felt things were unbearable as they were, and that there must be a change. Then one day I heard from Father that the Rev. Gregorius had asked for my hand in marriage. I was utterly astounded. He had never made me any advances, never given me the least intimation. He was an old friend of the family. Mother admired him. And Father, I think, was a bit scared of him. I went to my room and cried. In some special way I had always felt there was something repulsive about him; I believe it must have been this which made me decide to say yes. No one forced me. No one argued me into it. But I believed it was God’s will. Hadn’t I always been taught to believe that God’s will was always that which most contradicted our own? Hadn’t I lain awake, only last evening, praying to God for freedom and peace? Now I believed He had heard my prayers—in His own way. I thought I saw His will shining clearly before my eyes. Beside that man, so I fancied, my longings would be extinguished and desire die away. In this way, I thought, God had arranged things for me. And I was sure he must be a good and a fine man, since he was a clergyman."

"Men jag hade nu en gång föresatt mig att göra ett allvarligt nummer af den här konsultationen. Jag lyssnade mycket längre än jag egentligen behöfde, flyttade på hörröret, knackade och lyssnade omigen. Jag märkte hur det pinade honom att sitta tyst och passiv under allt detta – han är ju van att prata jämt, i kyrkan, i sällskap, i sitt hem; han har en afgjord begåfning för att prata, och troligtvis var det just denna lilla talang som först drog honom till hans yrke. Undersökningen var han litet rädd för, han skulle nog helst ha velat fortsätta en stund till med sina nattvardsbaciller för att sedan plötsligt se på klockan och rusa på dörren. Men nu hade jag honom där i soffhörnet, och jag släppte honom inte. Jag lyssnade och teg. Ju längre jag lyssnade, desto krångligare blef hans hjärta.","But I had once intended to make a serious issue of this consultation. I listened much longer than I really needed to, moved the earpiece, knocked and listened again. I noticed how it tormented him to sit quietly and passively during all this - he is used to talking constantly, in church, in company, in his home; he has a definite talent for talking, and it was probably precisely this little talent that first drew him to his profession. He was a little afraid of the examination, he would probably have preferred to continue for a while with his communion bacilli and then suddenly look at the clock and rush to the door. But now I had him there in the corner of the sofa, and I did not let him go. I listened and kept quiet. The longer I listened, the more complicated his heart became.","But I’d decided to turn this consultation into a real show. I listened much longer than I actually needed to, moved the stethoscope, tapped and listened some more. I noticed how it pained him to sit quietly and passively during all this—after all, he’s used to talking constantly, at church, in society, in his home; he has a definite talent for talking, and presumably it was precisely this minor talent that first drew him to his profession. The examination made him somewhat uneasy; he’d probably have preferred to go on for a while longer about communion germs and then suddenly glance at his watch and dash off. But now I had him there in the corner of the sofa, and I didn’t let him go. I listened and said nothing. The longer I listened, the worse his heart sounded.","But my mind was made up. This was going to be a serious consultation. I listened, much longer than necessary. Moved the tube. Tapped. Listened again. I noticed how it pained him, having to sit silent, passive, under all this—he’s used to talking incessantly, in church, in company, in his home. He has indeed, a distinct talent for it. And this little talent, it must have been, which first attracted him to his calling. My examination frightened him a bit—probably he would have preferred to run on awhile about his communion pills, and then, with a sudden glance at his watch, make a dash for the door. But now I had him on my sofa. And I wasn’t letting him slip away. Silently, I listened. And the longer I listened, the more troublesome his heart became."
"– Jag var så lycklig i min barndom och min första ungdom. Den tiden står för mig som en saga, när jag tänker på den. Alla tyckte om mig, och jag höll af alla och trodde alla om godt. Så kom den där åldern, ni vet. Men det gjorde ingen förändring i början, jag var ännu alltjämt lycklig, ja lyckligare än förut – ända till mitt tjugonde år. En ung flicka har också sin sinnlighet, det förstår ni nog, men i den allra första ungdomen gör den henne bara lycklig. Åtminstone var det så med mig. Blodet sjöng i mina öron, och jag sjöng också själf – sjöng ständigt, när jag gick i mina sysslor i hemmet, och smågnolade när jag gick på gatan ... Och jag var jämt förälskad. Jag hade växt upp i ett mycket religiöst hem; men jag trodde ändå inte att det var någon så förfärligt svår synd att kyssas. När jag var förälskad i någon ung man och han kysste mig, så lät jag det ske. Jag visste ju också att det fanns något annat, som man måste akta sig för och som var en förfärlig synd, men det stod för mig som något så oklart och aflägset, och det frestade mig inte. Nej, inte alls; jag förstod inte ens att det kunde fresta någon, jag trodde bara att det var något som man måste underkasta sig när man var gift och skulle ha barn, men ingenting som kunde ha någon betydelse i och för sig. Men när jag var tjugu år blef jag mycket förälskad i en man. Han såg bra ut och var god och fin – åtminstone trodde jag det då, och jag tror det ännu när jag tänker på honom. Ja, det måste han vara – han gifte sig sedan med en ungdomsväninna till mig, och han har gjort henne mycket lycklig. – Det var en sommar vi träffades, på landet. Vi kysstes. En dag förde han mig med sig långt in i skogen. Där försökte han förföra mig, och det var nära att han hade lyckats. O, om han hade lyckats, om jag inte hade sprungit min väg – hvad allting kunde vara annorlunda då mot nu! Då hade jag kanske blifvit gift med honom – åtminstone hade jag aldrig blifvit gift med den, som nu är min man. Jag hade kanske fått små barn och ett hem, ett verkligt hem; aldrig hade jag då behöft bli en otrogen hustru. – Men jag blef alldeles vild af blygsel och förskräckelse, jag vred mig ur hans armar och sprang min väg, sprang för brinnande lifvet.","- I was so happy in my childhood and my first youth. That time stands for me like a fairy tale, when I think of it. Everyone liked me, and I liked everyone and thought everyone was good. Then came that age, you know. But it did not change in the beginning, I was still happy, yes happier than before - until my twentieth year. A young girl also has her sensuality, you probably understand that, but in the very first youth it only makes her happy. At least that was the case with me. The blood sang in my ears, and I also sang myself - sang constantly, when I went about my chores at home, and nodded when I walked on the street ... And I was always in love. I had grown up in a very religious home; but I still did not think it was such a terrible sin to kiss. When I was in love with a young man and he kissed me, I let it happen. I also knew that there was something else that one had to beware of and that was a terrible sin, but it stood out to me as something so vague and distant, and it did not tempt me. No not at all; I did not even understand that it could tempt anyone, I just thought it was something you had to submit to when you were married and had children, but nothing that could have any meaning in itself. But when I was twenty, I fell in love with a man. He looked good and was good and nice - at least I thought so then, and I still think so when I think of him. Yes, he must be - he then married a teenage friend of mine, and he has made her very happy. - It was a summer we met, in the country. We kissed. One day he took me far into the woods. There he tried to seduce me, and it was close that he had succeeded. Oh, if he had succeeded, if I had not run my way - what could everything be different then to now! Then maybe I would have married him - at least I would never have married the one who is now my husband. I might have had small children and a home, a real home; never had I then had to become an unfaithful wife. But I went completely wild with shyness and terror, I twisted out of his arms and ran my way, ran for burning life.","“I was so happy as a child and young girl. That time seems like a fairy tale to me when I look back on it. Everyone liked me, and I loved everyone and believed the best of them. Then I reached a certain age—you know. But at first it made no difference; I was still happy, even happier than before—until I reached twenty. A young girl also has physical desires, I’m sure you know that, but at first, early on, this too makes her happy. At least that’s how it was for me.

"Återigen detsamma. Att jag dödade prästen. Att han måste dö, emedan han redan luktade lik, och att det var min plikt som läkare att göra det ... Jag fann det svårt och obehagligt, det var något som aldrig förr hade förekommit i min praktik – jag ville gärna konsultera en kollega, ville inte bära ansvaret ensam i en så allvarlig sak ... Men fru Gregorius stod naken i en vrå långt borta i halfmörkret och försökte skyla sig med ett litet svart flor. Och då hon hörde mig nämna ordet »kollega», fick hon ett så förskrämdt och förtvifladt uttryck i ögonen att jag förstod att det måste ske strax, att hon var förlorad annars, på något sätt som jag inte kunde reda ut, och att jag måste göra det ensam och så att ingen någonsin kunde få veta det. Så gjorde jag det då, med bortvändt hufvud. Hur gick det till? Jag vet inte. Jag vet bara att jag höll för näsan och vände bort hufvudet och sade för mig själf: se så, nu är det gjordt. Nu luktar han inte mer. Och jag ville förklara för fru Gregorius, att det var ett mycket sällsynt och egendomligt fall: de flesta människor lukta ju först efter döden och då begrafver man dem; men om någon luktar redan som lefvande, måste man döda honom, på vetenskapens nuvarande ståndpunkt finns det ingen annan utväg ... Men fru Gregorius var borta, det var bara ett stort tomrum omkring mig, i hvilket allt tycktes vika undan och fly för mig ... Mörkret ljusnade till en askgrå månskymning ... Och jag satt upprätt i bädden alldeles vaken och lyssnade till min egen röst ...","Again the same. That I killed the priest.

I found it difficult and uncomfortable, it was something that had never happened before in my practice - I wanted to consult a colleague , did not want to bear the responsibility alone in such a serious matter ... But Mrs. Gregorius stood naked in a corner far away in the semi-darkness and tried to cover himself with a small black bloom. And when she heard me mention the word ""colleague,"" she got such a frightened and despairing expression in her eyes that I understood that it must happen soon, that she was lost otherwise, in some way that I could not sort out, and that I must do it alone and so that no one could ever know. So I did it then, with my head turned away. How did it happen? I do not know. I only know that I held my nose and turned my head away and said to myself: look, now it's done. Now he no longer smells. And I wanted to explain to Mrs. Gregorius that it was a very rare and strange case: most people only smell after death and then you bury them; but if someone already smells like a living person, you have to kill him, in the current state of science there is no other way out ... But Mrs. Gregorius was gone, there was only a big void around me, in which everything seemed to give way and escape for me ... The darkness brightened to an ash-gray twilight of the moon ...

So I did it, with my head turned away. How did it happen? I don’t know. All I know is that I held my nose and turned away, saying to myself, “ There now, now it’s over. Now he doesn’t smell any longer.” And I wanted to explain to Mrs. Gregorius that this was a very strange and unusual case: most people start to smell only after they’re dead, and then you bury them, but if someone smells while still alive, then he has to be killed—given the present state of our scientific knowledge, there’s no alternative. But Mrs. Gregorius was gone; there was only a great emptiness around me in which everything seemed to pull back and flee from me . . .

But far off, Mrs Gregorius was standing naked in a corner, in half-darkness, trying to cover herself with a little black veil. And when she heard me utter the word ‘colleague’ such a desperate and terrified look came into her eyes I realised it had to be done at once. Otherwise, in some way I could not clearly understand, she was lost; and I must do it alone, in such a way that no one would ever find out. So, my head averted, I did it. How? I don’t know.

Sleep, until I need you; as for me, I will not wake you up in time. It's raining today, but tomorrow the sun may be shining. And only when the day dawns, when the sunshine itself seems plagued and sick to me, will I wake you to sleep myself.","Good night, you evil power. Sleep well in your small round box. Sleep until I need you; if it’s up to me I won’t awaken you unnecessarily. It’s raining today, but tomorrow perhaps the sun will shine. And only if the day comes when sunshine itself seems contaminated and diseased will I awaken you so that I myself may sleep.","Good-night, evil power. Sleep well in your little round box. Sleep till I need you. For me you shall have no untimely awakening. Today it’s raining, but perhaps tomorrow the sun will shine.

"Jag såg i drömmen gestalter från min ungdom. Jag såg henne som jag kysste en midsommarnatt för längesedan, då jag var ung och icke hade dödat någon. Jag såg också andra unga flickor af dem som hörde till vår krets den tiden; en, som gick och läste det året jag blef student och som alltid ville tala med mig om religionen; en annan, som var äldre än jag och som gärna stod och hviskade med mig i skymningen bakom en jasminhäck i vår trädgård. Och en annan, som alltid gjorde narr af mig, men som blef så ond och häftig och föll i krampgråt en gång då jag gjorde narr af henne ... De gingo bleka i en blek skymning, deras ögon stodo vidöppna och förskrämda, och de gjorde tecken åt hvarandra då jag närmade mig. Jag ville tala","I saw in the dream figures from my youth. I saw her kissing me one midsummer night a long time ago, when I was young and had not killed anyone. I also saw other young girls of those who belonged to our circle at that time; one, who went and read the year I became a student and who always wanted to talk to me about religion; another, who was older than me and who liked to stand and whisper with me at dusk behind a jasmine hedge in our garden. And another, who always made fun of me, but who became so evil and violent and fell into convulsive cries once when I made fun of her ... They went pale in a pale twilight, their eyes were wide open and frightened, and they made signs to each other as I approached. I wanted to talk","IN A DREAM I saw figures from my youth. I saw the girl I kissed one Midsummer night long ago, when I was young and hadn’t killed anyone. I saw other young girls, too, who belonged to our circle back then; one who was confirmed the same year I finished secondary school and always wanted to discuss religion; another, older than I, who liked to stand whispering with me in the twilight behind a jasmine hedge in our garden. And another who always made fun of me but became nasty and furious and sobbed uncontrollably once when I made fun of her . . . They were pale in the pale twilight, and they made signs to each other when I drew near. I wanted to talk to them, but they turned away and didn’t answer.","In a dream I saw figures from my youth.

Other young girls I saw, too, who belonged to our circle in those days; one who was being prepared for confirmation the year I took my student exam and who was always wanting to talk to me about religion; another, older than I, who was only too willing to stand whispering with me in our garden in the twilight behind a jasmine hedge. And another who always made a fool of me, but who, when I made a fool of her for a change, became furiously angry and went into convulsions of weeping….

"Regn och regn ... Och det regnar inte vatten, utan smuts. Atmosfären är inte grå längre, den är brun. Och när regnet ibland saktar af på en stund, ljusnar den till ett smutsigt gult.","Rain and rain ... And it does not rain water, but dirt. The atmosphere is no longer gray, it is brown. And when the rain sometimes slows down for a while, it turns a dirty yellow.","More rain . . . And what comes down isn’t moisture, but dirt. The sky isn’t gray any longer, it’s brown.

"Jag känner mig tom och lätt som ett urblåst ägg. Nyss, då jag kom inom salsdörren och såg mig själf i spegeln, studsade jag inför uttrycket i mitt ansikte: något visst tomt och utslätadt, något jag vet inte hvad, som kom mig att tänka på uret utan visare, som jag bär i min ficka. Och jag måste fråga mig själf: det där som du har gjort i dag – var det alltså hela ditt innehåll, finns det ingenting kvar nu därinne?","I feel empty and light like a blown egg. Recently, when I came inside the hall door and saw myself in the mirror, I bounced in front of the expression on my face: something certain empty and flattened, something I do not know what, that made me think of the clock without hands, which I carry in my pocket . And I have to ask myself: what you have done today - was it all your content, is there nothing left in there now?","I feel empty and light, like a blown-out egg. Just now, when I came through the parlor door and caught sight of myself in the mirror, the expression made me start: something empty, rubbed out, something indefinable that made me think of the watch without hands in my pocket. And I have to ask myself: what you did today—is that all there was inside you? Isn’t there anything left now?","I feel light, empty, like a blown egg. As I came in through the sitting-room door just now and saw myself in the mirror the expression on my face made me start. There was something empty, flat, about it; something, I don’t know what, reminding me of the handless watch I carry about with me in my pocket. And I had to ask myself: What you’ve done today—is that all there has been inside you, is nothing left?"
Jag måste le invärtes. Klas Recke och Amerika! Men jag blef stel då jag tänkte på henne. Jag tänkte: därborta kommer han att gå till botten genom alldeles samma egenskaper som han flyter på här. Och hvad blir det så af henne ...,I have to smile inside. Klas Recke and America! But I became stiff when I thought of her. I thought: over there he will go to the bottom through exactly the same characteristics that he floats on here. And what will become of her ...,I had to smile inside. Klas Recke and America!

"Det kom en förfärlig tid sedan. Jag ville inte se honom mera, vågade inte se honom. Han sände mig blommor, han skref bref på bref och bad mig förlåta. Men jag trodde att han var en usling; brefven svarade jag inte på, och blommorna kastade jag ut genom fönstret. – Men jag tänkte på honom, ständigt. Och nu var det inte längre bara kyssar jag tänkte på; nu visste jag hvad frestelsen var. Jag kände det som om det hade försiggått en förändring med mig, fast ingenting hade skett. Jag föreställde mig att man kunde se det på mig. Ingen kan förstå hur jag led. På hösten, när vi hade flyttat in till staden, var jag ute och gick ensam en eftermiddag i skymningen. Blåsten pep kring husknutarna, och det föll en regndroppe då och då. Jag kom in på den gatan, där jag visste att han bodde, och förbi huset. Jag stannade och såg att det lyste i hans fönster, jag såg hans hufvud i lampskenet, lutadt öfver en bok. Det drog mig som magnet, jag tyckte att det skulle vara så bra att vara därinne, hos honom. Jag smög mig in genom porten och uppför halfva trappan – där vände jag om.","It came a terrible time ago. I did not want to see him anymore, did not dare to see him. He sent me flowers, he wrote letter after letter asking me to forgive. But I thought he was a bastard; I did not reply to the letters, and I threw the flowers out the window. - But I thought of him, constantly. And now it was no longer just kisses I thought of; now I knew what the temptation was. I felt as if a change had taken place with me, even though nothing had happened. I imagined you could see it in me. No one can understand how I suffered. In the fall, when we had moved into the city, I was out walking alone one afternoon at dusk. The wind blew around the house knots, and a raindrop fell from time to time. I entered the street, where I knew he lived, and past the house. I stopped and saw that it shone in his window, I saw his head in the lamplight, leaning over a book. It drew me like a magnet, I thought it would be so good to be in there, with him. I snuck in through the gate and up half the stairs - there I turned around.","“The period after that was horrible. I didn’t want to see him again, didn’t dare see him. He sent me flowers, he wrote letter after letter begging me to forgive him. But I thought he was a scoundrel; I didn’t answer the letters, and I threw the flowers out the window. But I thought about him constantly. And now it wasn’t just kisses I thought about —now I knew what temptation was. I felt as if something about me had changed even though nothing had happened. I imagined people could tell by looking at me. No one can understand how I suffered. That autumn, when we’d moved back to town, I was out for a walk one afternoon by myself. The wind was whistling between the buildings and a drop of rain fell now and then. I turned down the street where I knew he lived and passed the house. I stopped and saw that the light was shining in his window; I could see his head in the lamplight bent over a book. It drew me like a magnet—I felt it would be so good to be inside there with him. I slipped in the door and went halfway up the stairs. There I turned around.","A terrible time followed. I didn’t want to see him any more, dared not.

The wind whined round the corners of the houses, and now and then a raindrop fell. I entered the street where I knew he lived, and walked past his house. Seeing a light burning in his window, I stopped, and in the lamplight saw his head bowed over a book. It attracted me like a magnet. I thought how nice it would be to be in there with him. I crept in through the doorway and was already halfway up the stairs—but then I turned back."
