{"source": "Tufts of cloud burned black before the sunrise, the horizon littered with the flotsam of old and rusted silhouettes. They were alone.\u2018Chemtrails,\u2019 the farmer had said to Alec, early on their walk. Other than this, he had been silent."}
{"source": "Fifty feet away, the field gave way to freshly tilled brown soil, forming mounds everywhere on the uneven earth. Chalky rocks littered the plot in every direction. Each step in this place was as muddy and wet as the last.Further still, a thin metal fence marked the edge of the land, clots of wool decorating the wire like fairy lights where the sheep had once tried to break through."}
{"source": "He swatted another fly away from his face.\u2018No,\u2019 the farmer said. \u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u2019\u2018Really? My wife tried doing that a few years back, and\u2014\u2019\u2018No,\u2019 the farmer said, and the conversation died.The world was still dark, even if only for a little while. The sun was almost free. The day had almost begun."}
{"source": "\u2018They\u2019re selling up to live with family, so she says.\u2019\u2018I think I saw them in town a few times,\u2019 Alec said. They were almost at the water tank, at the smile. \u2018Were they the ones who made those wagon wheels? They\u2019d mix sausage meat into a kind of \u2013 well, kind of cinnamon swirl, I suppose. It\u2019s delicious. Did you ever try one?\u2019"}
{"source": "\u2018Jean\u2019s moving out,\u2019 the farmer said. \u2018Did you know?\u2019\u2018Who?\u2019\u2018Jean . . . The lady who lives down the lane,\u2019 the farmer said, frowning. \u2018She\u2019s moving out, selling up her farm.\u2019\u2018Oh yes, Jean . . .\u2019 His voice drifted. \u2018I saw the sign.\u2019 Alec had driven past it on the way here, a farm twice the size of this one, its animals and land and people in far better condition. He had not known the name. He knew few out here. One more reminder that he did not belong, he supposed."}
{"source": "He gestured past a large, half-empty water tank around two hundred feet away, its translucent plastic grown stained with time, the smear of a smile where fluid had lapped within. \u2018We found them near there.\u2019 His face fell.Alec checked his watch. 7.06 a.m.The sun would soon rise.They kept on, the silence drowned out by the buzzing of the flies and the distant hellos of scraggly sheep out there in the semi-darkness."}
{"source": "Alec grimaced. He stepped back, tensing before rushing over the ditch. He came down with a thud, right into the thick and gelatinous mud. He splattered his black trouser legs and the farmer\u2019s jeans.The other man tutted, smiling. \u2018What have we come to, eh?\u2019Alec brushed at the muck around his ankles, but this only spread it further. His palms grew filthy.The farmer walked on."}
{"source": "Alec stared at the mud, and the farmer grinned, his cheeks ruddy beneath his dirty white beard. With that thick wax coat and that gut and that voice, he could have been a lunatic Santa Claus. \u2018You won\u2019t fall,\u2019 he said. \u2018Not afraid of a little dirt, are you, Sergeant Nichols?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019 Yes. \u2018I just hope you aren\u2019t wasting my time. And these flies . . .\u2019 Alec swatted one away from his rolled-up sleeve, a great bulbous thing that had nestled on the hairs of his forearm. He was food for this whole place.\u2018Try covering up next time,\u2019 the farmer said."}
{"source": "\u2018Where are they?\u2019 Alec asked, shivering. It was 6.55 a.m. He\u2019d left his jacket in his patrol car.\u2018There weren\u2019t any sheep over here,\u2019 the farmer said, ignoring the question. He leapt over the bank, his boots slipping slightly on the incline. \u2018They normally love coming over here.\u2019"}
{"source": "And now their torches revealed the edge of a bank, right before the crest of a shallow stream that cut through the farmer\u2019s reclaimed marshland. Along its muddy edge and all around, the reeds sang with flies and crickets and buntings."}
