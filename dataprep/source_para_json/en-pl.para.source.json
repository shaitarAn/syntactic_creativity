You could see the bright sparkle of the lake through the glass walls, and sunlight shifted through the moving branches of an ancient willow that shaded the house."}
{"source": "We had a system of accounting, a chart on a wall. There were merits and demerits. A merit was for an outrage success\u00adfully committed, a demerit for an act that should bring on humiliation. Juicy got merits for drooling into cocktails undetected, while Low got demerits for kissing up to a father. Probably not his own\u2014Low\u2019s parentage was a well-kept secret. But he\u2019d been spotted asking a guy with male-pattern baldness for wardrobe advice."}
{"source": "We had to hide the running, though, in case our haste betrayed us, so truer to say we slipped out quietly. When one of my parents appeared, my technique was: pretend to catch sight of someone in the next room. Move in a natural manner toward this figment of my imagination, making a purposeful face. Go through the door. And fade away."}
{"source": "As the evenings wore on, some parents got it into their heads to dance. A flash of life would move their lumpen bodies. Sad spectacle. They flopped, blasting their old-time music. \u201cBeat on the brat, beat on the brat, beat on the brat with a baseball bat, oh yeah.\u201d"}
{"source": "Later the talk grew louder. Freed of our influence, some of them emitted sudden, harsh barks. Apparently, laughing. From the wrap\u00adaround porch, with its bamboo torches and hanging ferns and porch swings, moth-eaten armchairs and blue-light bug zappers, the barks of laughter carried. We heard them from the treehouses and tennis courts and from the field of beehives a slow neighbor woman tended in the daytime, muttering under the veil of her beekeeping hat. We heard them from behind the cracked panes of the dilapidated greenhouse or on the cool black water of the lake, where we floated in our underwear at midnight."}
{"source": "THE GREAT HOUSE had been built by robber barons in the nineteenth century, a palatial retreat for the green months. Our parents, those so-called figures of authority, roamed its rooms in vague circuits beneath the broad beams, their objectives murky. And of no general interest."}
{"source": "The lady urinated. \u201cOh, poor old thing, she has a nervous bladder!\u201d exclaimed someone\u2019s chubby mother. \u201cIs that a Persian rug?\u201d Whose mother was it? Unclear. No one would cop to it, of course. We canceled the performance. \u201cAdmit it, that was your mother,\u201d said a kid named Rafe to a kid named Sukey, when the parents had filed out. Some of their goblets, highball glasses, and beer bottles were completely empty. Drained. Those parents were in a hurry, then. \u201cNo way,\u201d said Sukey firmly, and shook her head. \u201cThen who is your mother? The one with the big ass? Or the one with the clubfoot?\u201d \u201cNeither,\u201d said Sukey. \u201cSo fuck you.\u201d"}
{"source": "One dog got makeup applied to its face, lipstick and blue eye shadow. It was a white-faced dog, so the makeup showed up well. We liked to have an impact. When we were done, the lipstick went back into some mother\u2019s Fendi handbag. We watched her apply it, unaware. That was satisfying."}
{"source": "We put the dogs in a play and invited the parents, since there was no one else to be an audience. But the pets were poorly trained and failed to take direction. There were two soldiers and a fancy lady we\u2019d dressed in a frilly padded bra. The soldiers were cowards. Deserters, basically. They ran away when we issued the battle cry. (A blaring klaxon. It went hoh-onk.)"}
{"source": "Even the smallest canoe could take us down to the ocean. We\u2019d paddle across the lake, over a marsh, down a stream, and come to the river\u2019s mouth. Where the water met the sky. We\u2019d run along the beach on a salt breeze, leaving our boats on the sand."}
