{"source": "Tufts of cloud burned black before the sunrise, the horizon littered with the flotsam of old and rusted silhouettes."}
{"source": "They were alone."}
{"source": "'Chemtrails,' the farmer had said to Alec, early on their walk."}
{"source": "Other than this, he had been silent."}
{"source": "Fifty feet away, the field gave way to freshly tilled brown soil, forming mounds everywhere on the uneven earth."}
{"source": "Chalky rocks littered the plot in every direction."}
{"source": "Each step in this place was as muddy and wet as the last."}
{"source": "Further still, a thin metal fence marked the edge of the land, clots of wool decorating the wire like fairy lights where the sheep had once tried to break through."}
{"source": "He swatted another fly away from his face."}
{"source": "'No,' the farmer said."}
{"source": "'I'm a vegetarian.'"}
{"source": "'Really?"}
{"source": "My wife tried doing that a few years back, and\u2014' 'No,' the farmer said, and the conversation died."}
{"source": "The world was still dark, even if only for a little while."}
{"source": "The sun was almost free."}
{"source": "The day had almost begun."}
{"source": "'They're selling up to live with family, so she says.'"}
{"source": "'I think I saw them in town a few times,' Alec said."}
{"source": "They were almost at the water tank, at the smile."}
{"source": "'Were they the ones who made those wagon wheels?"}
{"source": "They'd mix sausage meat into a kind of well, kind of cinnamon swirl, I suppose."}
{"source": "It's delicious."}
{"source": "Did you ever try one?'"}
{"source": "'Jean's moving out,' the farmer said."}
{"source": "'Did you know?'"}
{"source": "'Who?' 'Jean ... The lady who lives down the lane,' the farmer said, frowning."}
{"source": "'She's moving out, selling up her farm.'"}
{"source": "'Oh yes, Jean ...'"}
{"source": "His voice drifted."}
{"source": "'I saw the sign.'"}
{"source": "Alec had driven past it on the way here, a farm twice the size of this one, its animals and land and people in far better condition."}
{"source": "He had not known the name."}
{"source": "He knew few out here."}
{"source": "One more reminder that he did not belong, he supposed."}
{"source": "He gestured past a large, half-empty water tank around two hundred feet away, its translucent plastic grown stained with time, the smear of a smile where fluid had lapped within."}
{"source": "'We found them near there.'"}
{"source": "His face fell."}
{"source": "Alec checked his watch."}
{"source": "7.06 a.m."}
{"source": "The sun would soon rise."}
{"source": "They kept on, the silence drowned out by the buzzing of the flies and the distant hellos of scraggly sheep out there in the semi-darkness."}
{"source": "Alec grimaced."}
{"source": "He stepped back, tensing before rushing over the ditch."}
{"source": "He came down with a thud, right into the thick and gelatinous mud."}
{"source": "He splattered his black trouser legs and the farmer's jeans."}
{"source": "The other man tutted, smiling."}
{"source": "'What have we come to, eh?'"}
{"source": "Alec brushed at the muck around his ankles, but this only spread it further."}
{"source": "His palms grew filthy."}
{"source": "The farmer walked on."}
{"source": "Alec stared at the mud, and the farmer grinned, his cheeks ruddy beneath his dirty white beard."}
{"source": "With that thick wax coat and that gut and that voice, he could have been a lunatic Santa Claus."}
{"source": "'You won't fall,' he said."}
{"source": "'Not afraid of a little dirt, are you, Sergeant Nichols?'"}
{"source": "'No.'"}
{"source": "Yes."}
{"source": "'I just hope you aren't wasting my time."}
{"source": "And these flies ...'"}
{"source": "Alec swatted one away from his rolled-up sleeve, a great bulbous thing that had nestled on the hairs of his forearm."}
{"source": "He was food for this whole place."}
{"source": "'Try covering up next time,' the farmer said."}
{"source": "'Where are they?'"}
{"source": "Alec asked, shivering."}
{"source": "It was 6.55 a.m."}
{"source": "He'd left his jacket in his patrol car."}
{"source": "'There weren't any sheep over here,' the farmer said, ignoring the question."}
{"source": "He leapt over the bank, his boots slipping slightly on the incline."}
{"source": "'They normally love coming over here.'"}
{"source": "And now their torches revealed the edge of a bank, right before the crest of a shallow stream that cut through the farmer's reclaimed marshland."}
{"source": "Along its muddy edge and all around, the reeds sang with flies and crickets and buntings."}
{"source": "Alec grimaced."}
{"source": "He stepped back, tensing before rushing over the ditch."}
{"source": "He came down with a thud, right into the thick and gelatinous mud."}
{"source": "He splattered his black trouser legs and the farmer's jeans."}
