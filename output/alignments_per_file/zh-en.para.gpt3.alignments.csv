1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"The winter of 1993 was the most important time for me, because my father had returned. It was the week before my mother’s wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me. I ran all the way to the school gates, and from behind the iron bars, I could see him standing outside, smoking. He was wearing a black long coat, and the upturned collar was covering half of his face. I don’t know why, but even without seeing his face clearly, I could tell that he wasn’t doing well. My heart ached, and tears started to fall.",3-3 6-1 10-7 11-8 14-14 15-16 19-23 20-24 21-27 22-22 23-20 24-21 25-28 26-32 28-29 29-30 30-33 31-34 32-36 33-38 34-39 35-40 36-41 37-42 38-43 40-44 42-48 44-51 45-53 47-49 48-59 50-52 53-65 54-66 55-67 56-68 57-70 59-71 61-74 63-76 64-77 67-80 72-79 73-89 74-90 75-91 77-94 78-95 79-100 80-101 85-105 86-106 91-115 96-120 97-121 98-122 99-123 100-124 101-125 103-129 104-132 105-109 106-133
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Deep down, I felt that she should remain in pain and sorrow, just like me, due to my father’s departure. Besides, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. Perhaps that was true, but happiness had the ability to find her. After all, as a beautiful woman, she didn’t have to work so hard. She didn’t have to do anything—she just had to stand still.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-4 4-5 5-6 6-8 10-11 11-12 13-13 16-15 17-17 18-19 19-20 21-35 22-37 23-40 25-21 26-23 28-27 29-29 30-30 32-41 34-43 35-44 36-46 37-48 38-50 43-56 44-60 45-57 48-61 49-62 50-63 51-64 52-52 53-68 54-69 58-73 59-74 60-77 61-78 64-86 65-87 67-79 68-96 70-93 71-95 73-99 74-102 78-104
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember that the winter that year was particularly long. It was already halfway through April, and the peach blossoms still hadn’t bloomed. Your mood was very low due to your parents’ divorce. We hadn’t had any new games for a long time, so in the evenings we would just sit on the roof of the Dead Man’s Tower, with nothing to do. Among the body parts scattered around the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms. We hooked them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Armed Guanyin.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-6 4-7 6-5 7-9 8-10 10-18 13-15 14-19 17-23 18-14 19-33 21-45 22-47 26-37 27-38 28-40 30-41 31-36 32-49 35-55 36-56 37-57 39-62 42-66 49-71 50-77 51-78 53-80 55-74 56-72 58-99 59-100 61-95 63-90 65-91 67-92 69-101 71-107 72-106 75-108 76-109 77-110 82-113 83-111 85-114 86-82 88-119 89-120 93-81 94-133
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father, in fact, had no idea how to do business, but he had gone to seek refuge with a distant cousin. My grandmother had a younger sister who had gone to Beijing in her youth, and had gotten married and had children there. This cousin was her eldest son, and had always been an outcast in the family.",0-0 1-1 4-11 5-12 8-7 9-8 10-13 11-14 12-17 15-23 16-24 21-25 22-26 23-27 25-31 26-35 30-38 31-40 32-44 34-53 35-49 38-54 39-55 41-56 42-57 43-58 46-61 50-72 51-70 53-65 55-68 58-73
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now you said that everyone has a time when they start their journey, as if their life has suddenly been put on a leash. Mine was when I was eight. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing by himself. From then on, I no longer had a home.",1-1 2-3 3-5 4-6 7-8 8-14 9-18 10-16 11-20 12-22 15-26 16-27 17-28 20-33 22-34 23-35 26-38 27-39 28-41 29-42 33-46 34-48 35-51 36-52 37-53 38-54 39-55 40-56 41-58 42-59 43-61 45-62
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I had no intention of keeping the appointment. For whatever reason, I felt that there was no longer any need for us to meet. I was sitting on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, when the sky gradually darkened. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The water delivery boy was standing outside, carrying a bucket of water, saying he was delivering it to a family in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty gray woolen hat, and his expression was dazed.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 7-9 9-12 11-23 13-19 14-25 18-26 19-27 20-29 22-32 23-30 27-34 28-36 30-42 34-39 35-59 39-44 43-60 44-63 47-64 48-69 55-76 56-77 57-83 58-88 60-84 62-85 63-80 64-62 66-91 67-92 69-70 70-71 71-73 72-96 76-98 77-100 78-97 79-103 84-110 85-111
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Every time we fell into a silence, I felt my heart being compressed, and I just wanted to end the meeting as soon as possible. You seemed to have noticed, but still kept trying to find a topic of conversation. The tea had cooled down, and the white mist in the room had dispersed. Finally, you stood up to leave. Just as I closed the door, I felt a sense of relief. But then the doorbell rang again. You were standing outside the door, asking me to come to Little White Tower later. Before I had a chance to refuse, you had already walked out of the doorway.",1-0 2-1 4-3 5-4 6-5 7-6 8-9 9-12 10-13 12-15 13-17 14-18 15-19 16-21 17-22 18-26 19-32 21-28 22-29 23-30 24-35 25-36 26-37 29-40 30-41 31-42 32-44 33-45 34-47 35-49 37-54 38-56 41-67 44-62 45-64 51-73 56-52 59-84 60-57 61-86 62-87 63-89 68-74 69-98 70-99 71-101 72-100 75-75 76-76 79-109 80-110 81-111 84-114 85-115 86-116 87-117 89-119 90-88 91-81 95-126 98-103 99-130 100-106 101-107 104-137
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？“你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家“　你问。 ""嗯。“","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist. You sat down awkwardly and watched me pour the tea.

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath that came out of your mouth, the curls of your hair that were being blown by the wind, and the slight trembling of your knees beneath the hem of your coat—all of these made me believe that you were a real person, and not just a continuation of the dream I had before. It was no surprise that I couldn’t recognize you after not seeing you for eighteen years. You weren’t wearing any makeup, and your pale face was a little swollen, but you had still managed to live up to everyone’s expectations and become a beautiful woman. Your peach-shaped face was a little gloomy, and you had the look of someone who had been in the city for a long time. You asked me if you looked different from what I had imagined. I just smiled without answering. To be honest, I had never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. Everything related to you had already been sealed away in a file folder, and the glue was dry. It might hurt to say this, but I had never expected to see you again.",1-8 2-6 4-3 5-1 7-2 9-18 16-15 17-9 24-29 25-30 28-12 30-47 31-49 32-50 36-55 37-56 38-57 39-59 40-38 41-69 43-66 44-121 45-63 46-70 47-87 48-89 57-74 59-52 61-96 62-98 66-135 69-139 71-109 75-79 78-119 79-122 82-124 83-54 84-127 97-99 100-155 101-102 102-158 105-108 107-161 108-162 110-111 113-168 114-172 116-167 118-175 123-177 126-182 127-185 130-186 131-187 132-189 133-190 134-191 135-81 139-202 142-142 144-204 146-203 147-208 149-213 150-215 153-210 157-224 158-229 160-226 162-106 163-227 166-231 167-232 170-179 171-236 173-239 174-240 175-238 176-241
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes, and there you were, standing in the doorway. I don’t know how long you had been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my dream. And the sadness of waking up, the look of my weakest moment. Cheng Gong, you called my name in a low, hoarse voice, as if you hadn’t spoken in a long time. It was about to snow, and the sky was very dark. The room was pitch black. The water in the stove was boiling, bubbling and rolling. I looked at you for a while, to make sure I didn’t recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing across from me was somehow deeply connected to my life. I felt a chill down my spine.
