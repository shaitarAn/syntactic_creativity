1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my father returned, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me. I ran all the way to the gate and saw him standing outside smoking through the iron fence from a distance. He was wearing a black long trench coat with his collar up hiding half his face. I didn't know why, even though I couldn't see his face clearly, but it seemed as if he wasn't doing very well. My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.",3-4 4-25 5-1 6-2 7-5 10-8 11-9 14-15 15-16 17-17 18-18 19-22 20-23 21-26 22-21 24-20 25-27 26-31 28-28 29-29 30-32 31-33 32-35 33-37 34-38 35-39 36-40 37-41 38-42 40-43 42-47 44-49 45-50 47-48 48-59 53-51 54-52 55-53 56-54 57-55 59-65 61-68 63-70 64-71 71-78 72-75 73-81 75-83 77-85 78-86 79-91 80-92 83-101 86-100 88-93 91-110 94-103 95-115 96-116 97-117 98-118 99-119 100-120 101-121 104-126 106-130
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarriage. Maybe subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer over my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt she didn't have the ability to find happiness again. This might actually be true, but perhaps happiness has the ability to find her instead. Isn't it? As a beautiful woman, she doesn't have to work so hard; she doesn't need to do anything but stand still.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-4 4-5 5-6 6-8 7-10 11-11 12-12 13-13 14-14 15-15 16-16 17-18 18-20 19-21 21-27 22-29 23-32 25-22 26-24 28-33 29-35 30-36 32-37 34-39 35-40 36-42 37-43 38-47 40-51 42-49 43-54 44-59 45-56 46-57 48-60 49-61 50-63 51-64 53-68 54-69 56-75 59-78 60-81 61-82 64-90 65-91 67-93 68-100 70-97 71-99 74-102 77-70 78-104
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that year winter was particularly long, it was already mid-April, but the winter jasmine flowers had not yet bloomed. Your parents' divorce dampened your mood a lot. We hadn't had any new games for a long time and at dusk we would sit idly on top of the tower in the cemetery. Among those scattered body parts in the yard, a few more arms were added. We used hooks to pull them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin statue.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 6-6 7-8 8-9 9-10 10-16 17-25 18-27 19-29 21-34 22-36 26-40 27-41 30-31 31-32 32-45 35-51 36-52 37-53 42-61 44-65 48-66 49-64 53-70 56-67 57-78 59-77 60-88 64-81 65-86 67-87 69-91 71-94 72-93 75-95 76-98 77-99 78-100 79-101 80-102 82-105 83-104 85-106 88-111 89-112 90-113 91-117 92-120 93-121 94-122
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"In fact, my father knows nothing about doing business, he just went to join a cousin who he wasn't very familiar with. My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing when she was young and later got married and had children there. This cousin is her eldest son, and has always been seen as an odd one out in the entire family.",0-3 1-4 3-7 4-8 5-9 8-6 9-5 10-10 11-12 12-13 13-15 15-16 16-22 18-24 21-17 22-26 23-27 25-31 26-33 31-37 32-42 33-43 34-49 35-45 38-50 39-51 41-52 42-53 43-54 46-57 47-58 49-71 50-72 51-69 53-61 54-64 55-66 58-73
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You just said that everyone has a time when their fate starts to take hold, as if life is suddenly reined in. It seems mine started at eight years old. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. After that, I no longer had a home.",2-2 3-4 4-5 7-7 8-16 9-19 10-18 11-21 12-14 15-15 16-25 17-28 20-31 21-32 22-34 23-35 26-38 27-39 28-41 29-42 32-49 33-46 34-48 35-50 37-52 38-51 40-54 41-56 42-57 43-59 45-60
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I have no intention of keeping the appointment. No matter the reason, I don't think we need to see each other again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, as it grew darker and darker outside, there came a sudden knock at the door. The boy who delivers water was standing at my door front with a bucket in tow, saying he had to deliver water to a family in West Suburb. He was wearing a dirty grey woolen hat and looked dazed.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 6-9 7-12 9-13 11-19 13-25 14-22 18-26 19-27 20-28 22-31 23-29 27-33 28-35 32-41 33-43 34-49 35-58 36-54 40-55 43-59 47-61 51-75 55-79 56-80 57-86 58-90 60-87 62-88 63-84 64-65 66-93 67-94 68-96 70-73 72-98 76-100 77-102 79-105 81-108 84-109 85-110
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was tough. Each time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being oppressed and just wanted to end this meeting quickly. You seemed to notice something but were still trying hard to find a topic of conversation. As the tea got cold, the white fog in the room had dissipated, and you finally stood up to leave. Right after I closed the door and breathed a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again. You were standing at the doorway asking me to come over to Xiaobai Building later on. Before I had a chance to refuse, you'd already left through the building's entrance.",1-0 2-1 5-3 6-4 7-5 8-8 9-10 10-11 12-13 13-15 14-16 15-18 16-19 17-20 18-22 19-27 21-24 22-25 23-26 24-28 25-29 26-30 29-32 31-34 32-36 33-37 34-40 35-44 36-45 37-48 38-50 40-51 41-57 44-53 45-54 50-64 51-65 55-69 57-73 61-76 69-87 70-88 71-90 72-89 74-91 76-94 80-99 81-100 84-104 86-106 87-107 89-110 91-93 95-117 97-118 98-92 99-122 100-74 102-126 104-131
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？“你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家“　你问。 ""嗯。“","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist. You sat down uncomfortably, watching me pour tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"" You asked.

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, the slightly trembling knees under your coat hemline, all these make me believe that you standing before me are really there and not an extension of a dream I had before. It's been eighteen years since we last saw each other; it's no surprise I don't recognize you. You are without makeup−a pale face and slightly swollen, but at least you didn't disappoint everyone's expectations and grew into a beautiful woman. It’s just that heart-shaped little face of yours looks gloomy as if stayed for too long in a big city. You asked me if your appearance is different than what I imagined. I just responded with an ambiguous smile. Honestly speaking, I've never imagined how would look like grown up . To me, everything related to you has already been put in file bags and sealed with wax seal; sad to say perhaps but it might hurt—I really didn’t expect to meet you again.",1-8 3-4 5-1 7-2 10-19 12-16 14-14 16-13 17-20 22-28 23-22 24-23 25-24 27-25 28-27 29-34 30-36 31-38 32-39 36-46 37-47 38-48 39-49 40-45 41-42 43-54 44-109 45-51 46-58 47-63 48-65 50-69 53-82 57-77 58-84 59-85 60-87 62-88 65-12 68-94 69-134 71-97 72-98 78-107 79-110 80-111 81-112 82-114 83-115 84-117 86-122 87-123 91-128 92-92 100-147 102-143 107-149 108-150 110-101 111-154 114-160 116-156 125-172 126-173 127-174 128-175 129-177 130-178 131-179 132-182 133-183 134-184 135-200 136-146 139-148 142-196 144-198 146-197 147-202 148-204 149-205 150-206 151-207 152-208 153-209 154-211 156-213 158-217 160-221 163-222 171-229 173-232 174-233 175-231 176-234
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You were standing at the door. I don't know how long you had been there, you might even have seen me laughing in my dream. And the sadness when I woke up, and how I looked at my weakest moment. Cheng Gong, you softly called my name, your voice was very hoarse, as if you haven't spoken for a long time. It was about to snow; it was severely overcast and dark inside the room. The water on the stove boiled and rolled with gurgling sounds. I looked at you carefully for a while, sure that I didn't recognize you.
