1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"The most important event for me in that winter of 1993 was my father's return, the week before my mother's wedding.",1-1
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"One afternoon in December, he came to see me at school.",1-1
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。,"I ran all the way to the gate, and saw him standing outside smoking a cigarette from a distance through the iron railing.",1-1
4,身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"He was wearing a long black windbreaker, with the raised collar covering half of his face.",1-1
5,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"I don't know why, I didn't even see his appearance clearly, but I felt that he seemed to be having a bad time.",1-1
6,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"My heart was sour, and tears fell out.",1-1
7,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I never thought that my mother would have the idea of remarrying.,1-1
8,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should suffer because of my dad's departure, just like me.",1-1
9,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。,"Besides, I think she lacks that ability to find happiness.",1-1
10,事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"That may be true, but happiness has the power to find her.",1-1
11,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"Isn't it, as a beauty, it doesn't have to be so hard at all, she doesn't have to do anything, she just needs to stand where she is.",1-1
12,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"I still remember that the winter of that year was very long, halfway through April, and the winter jasmine hadn't bloomed yet.",1-1
13,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,The divorce of your parents has made you very depressed.,1-1
14,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We haven't had any new games for a long time, and we just sit helplessly on the roof of the Tower of the Dead in the evening.",1-1
15,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,"Among the body parts scattered in the yard, there were a few more arms.",1-1
16,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,We used hooks to pull them together to form a thousand-armed Avalokitesvara.,1-1
17,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,"My father actually knew nothing about business, he just went to join a cousin he didn't know well.",1-1
18,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,My grandma has a younger sister who went to Beijing in her early years and later got married and had children there.,1-1
19,这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"This cousin is the eldest son of her family, and has always existed as a different kind in the whole family.",1-1
20,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"Just now you said that everyone has a time to start luck, and life seems to be put on the reins suddenly.",1-1
21,我的应该是在八岁。,Mine should be around eight years old.,1-1
22,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,"That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.",1-1
23,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Since then, I have never had a home.",1-1
24,我并不打算赴约。,I'm not going to make an appointment.,1-1
25,不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,"No matter what the reason is, I don't think there is any need for us to meet again.",1-1
26,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。,"I sat on the sofa and smoked cigarettes one by one. It was getting darker and darker, and there was a sudden knock on the door.",1-2
27,送 水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,"The water delivery boy was standing at the door with a bucket on his shoulders, saying that he was delivering water to a family in the western suburbs.",2-1
28,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,He wore a dirty gray woolen hat and looked dazed.,1-1
29,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,Our conversation was difficult.,1-1
30,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time I fall into silence, I feel that my heart is being oppressed, and I just want to end this meeting quickly.",1-1
31,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seem to be aware of it, but are still trying to find something to talk about.",1-1
32,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"The tea is cold, the white mist in the room has cleared, and you finally get up to say goodbye.",1-1
33,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,"I just closed the door, feeling relieved, when the doorbell rang again.",1-1
34,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。,You stand at the door and invite me to come to Xiaobailou later.,1-1
35,我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"I haven't had time to refuse, you have already walked out of the cave.",1-1
36,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I went to the kitchen and turned off the stove.,1-1
37,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"Half of the pot of water has evaporated, and the whole room is filled with white mist.",1-1
38,你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。,You sit down awkwardly and watch me pour tea.,1-1
39,"""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？"" 你问。","""Do you still live with your grandma and aunt?"" you ask.",2-1
40,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"Let me tell you, grandma has passed away, and now I live with my aunt.",1-1
41,"""她一直没成家"" 你问。","""She never had a family"" you ask.",1-1
42,"""嗯。""","""Ok.",1-1
43,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"The white breath out of your mouth, the curly hair lifted by the wind, the slightly trembling knees under the hem of the coat, all these make me believe that the you in front of me is a real existence, not a continuation of the previous dream.",1-1
44,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,"I haven't seen her for eighteen years, so it's not surprising that I don't recognize her.",1-1
45,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。,"You don't have any makeup on, your pale face is a little swollen, but you have finally lived up to everyone's expectations, and you have grown into a beauty.",1-1
46,只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"It's just that the little peachy face is dark and sad, with an expression of staying in the big city for a long time.",1-1
47,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,You ask me if your appearance is different from what I imagined.,1-1
48,我不置可否地笑了笑。,I smiled noncommittally.,1-1
49,坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,"Frankly, I never imagined what you would look like when you grew up.",1-1
50,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"To me, everything about you is in the portfolio and sealed.",1-1
51,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"It might hurt to say it, but I really don't look forward to seeing you again.",1-1
52,我睁开眼睛。,I open my eyes.,1-1
53,你站在门囗。,You stand at the door.,1-1
54,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。,"I don't know how long you've been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my dream.",1-1
55,还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,"And the sadness of waking up, the look of the weakest moment.",1-1
56,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"Cheng Gong, you called out my name in a low voice, your voice was very hoarse, it seemed that you hadn't spoken for a long time.",1-1
57,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,"It was about to snow, the sky was very cloudy, and the house was dark.",1-1
58,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,The water on the stove was boiling and tumbling.,1-1
59,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。,"I looked at you carefully for a while, and was sure I didn't know you.",1-1
60,可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite seemed to have a deep connection with my life.",1-1
61,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,That feeling sent chills down the back.,1-1
62,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。,"I tried hard to recall, and the memory cards flipped in my mind.",1-1
63,然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"Then you said, you are Li Jiaqi.",1-1
