1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my dad came back, just one week before my mom was to be married.",1-1
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"One afternoon in December, he came to school to look for me.",1-1
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。,"I dashed towards the main gate and saw him standing outside smoking, from a distance through the iron bars.",1-1
4,身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"Wearing a black overcoat, the raised collar concealed half of the face.",1-1
5,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"I don't know why, even though I didn't get a clear look at him, I feel like he's not doing well.",1-1
6,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.",1-1
7,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.,1-1
8,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I feel that she should continue to suffer because of my dad's departure, just like me.",1-1
9,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。,"Moreover, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness.",1-1
10,事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"Perhaps this is indeed the case, but happiness has the ability to find her.",1-1
11,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"Isn't it true? As a beautiful person, she doesn't have to work so hard. She doesn't have to do anything, just standing there is enough.",1-3
12,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"I still remember, the winter that year was especially long. Halfway through April, the spring flowers had not yet bloomed.",1-2
13,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,The matter of your parents' divorce is making you feel very depressed.,1-1
14,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We haven't had any new games for a long time, so we just aimlessly sit on the roof of the Dead Man's Tower every evening.",1-1
15,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,"In the yard, several more arms have been added to the scattered body parts.",1-1
16,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"We used hooks to bring them together, arranging them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin.",1-1
17,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,"Actually, my father knows nothing about doing business, he just went to seek help from a cousin he isn't even that familiar with.",1-1
18,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,"My grandmother has a sister, who moved to Beijing in her early years and later got married and had children there.",1-1
19,这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"This cousin is the eldest son of her family, and has always been considered an outcast in the entire clan.",1-1
20,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"Just now you said that everyone has a time when their destiny begins, as if life is suddenly reined in.",1-1
21,我的应该是在八岁。,I think I was about eight years old.,1-1
22,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,"That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.",1-1
23,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Since then, I have no longer had a home.",1-1
24,我并不打算赴约。,I don't plan to keep the appointment.,1-1
25,不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,"No matter what the reason is, I think there is no need for us to meet again.",1-1
26,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。,"I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. The sky was getting darker and darker when suddenly there was a firm knock at the door.",1-2
27,送,Deliver,1-1
28,水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,"The boy with the water was standing at the doorway carrying a bucket, saying he was going to deliver water to a family in the western suburbs.",1-1
29,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"He is wearing a dirty, grey wool hat, with a dazed expression.",1-1
30,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,Our conversation is going very difficultly.,1-1
31,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time I fall into silence, I feel a pressure on my heart, and I just want to end this meeting quickly.",1-1
32,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic to talk about.",1-1
33,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"The tea has cooled down, the white mist in the room has completely dispersed, and you finally stand up to take your leave.",1-1
34,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,I had just closed the door and let out a sigh of relief when the doorbell rang again.,1-1
35,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。,"You're standing at the door, please invite me to come to the little white building later.",1-1
36,我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Before I even had a chance to refuse, you had already stepped out of the building.",1-1
37,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.,1-1
38,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"Half a pot of water has already evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist.",1-1
39,你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。,"You sit down restlessly, watching me pour the tea.",1-1
40,"""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""",Are you still living with your grandmother and aunt?,1-1
41,你问。,You ask.,1-1
42,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"I told you, grandma has passed away, now I live with my aunt.",1-1
43,"""她一直没成家"" 你问。","""She never settled down,"" you ask.",1-1
44,"""嗯。""",Hmm.,1-1
45,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, the knees slightly trembling under your coat's hem, these make me believe that you truly exist here before me, not merely an extension of a previous dream.",1-1
46,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,"It's been eighteen years, so it's not strange if you don't recognize me.",1-1
47,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。,"You are not wearing makeup, your pale face is a bit puffy, but at least you have not let everyone down, you've grown into a beautiful person.",1-1
48,只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"It's just that her peach-heart-shaped face has a gloomy look, expressing the demeanor of someone who has been in the big city for a long time.",1-1
49,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,"You ask me, if you look different from what I had imagined.",1-1
50,我不置可否地笑了笑。,I smiled noncommittally.,1-1
51,坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,"To be honest, I have never imagined what you would look like when you grew up.",1-1
52,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"For me, everything related to you has already been packed into a file bag and sealed with sealing wax.",1-1
53,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"It might hurt to say this, but honestly, I really have no desire to see you again.",1-1
54,我睁开眼睛。,I open my eyes.,1-1
55,你站在门囗。,You are standing at the door.,1-1
56,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。,"I don't know how long you have been standing there, you probably even saw me laughing in my dreams.",1-1
57,还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,"There's also the sadness of waking up, the appearance at our weakest moment.",1-1
58,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"Cheng Gong, you call out my name in a low voice, your voice very hoarse, as if it's been a long time since you last spoke.",1-1
59,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,"It's about to snow, the sky is terribly overcast, and the room is pitch black.",1-1
60,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,"The water on the stove is boiling, gurgling and rolling over.",1-1
61,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。,"I looked at you carefully for a while, sure that I don't know you.",1-1
62,可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite me seemed to have a deep connection with my life.",1-1
63,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,That kind of feeling sends a chill down one's spine.,1-1
64,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。,"I am trying hard to recall, with the cards of memory flipping over and over in my mind.",1-1
65,然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"Then you said, you are Li Jiaqi.",1-1
