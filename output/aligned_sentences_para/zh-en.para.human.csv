1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"The most significant event of winter 1993, as far as I was concerned, was Dad's return—the week before Mom's marriage.",1-1
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"One afternoon in December, he showed up at my school and asked for me.",1-1
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。 身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"I ran all the way to the gate. He was smoking some distance away on the other side of the metal fence, in a long black coat whose upturned collar hid half his face.",2-2
4,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"Even before I could get a proper look at him, I had a feeling he wasn't doing well.",1-1
5,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"I felt a twinge in my heart, and tears came to my eyes.",1-1
6,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I'd never imagined Mom would want to marry again.,1-1
7,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I wanted her to keep suffering from Dad's departure, just like I was.",1-1
8,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。 事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"Besides, I felt she lacked the ability to find happiness—but it turned out happiness was still able to find her.",2-1
9,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"She was attractive enough that she didn't need to make any special effort, just standing there sufficed.",1-1
10,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"That winter felt particularly long. Halfway through April, the first flowers hadn't yet bloomed.",1-2
11,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,You were feeling low because of your parents' divorce.,1-1
12,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We'd stopped playing games. In the evenings, we sat on the wall around Dead Man's Tower.",1-2
13,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,There were now more dismembered arms among the body parts in the courtyard.,1-1
14,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"We reached for them with a grappling hook, pulling them into the shape of a thousand-handed Goddess of Mercy.",1-1
15,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,Dad didn't actually know anything about business—he was just throwing his lot in with a cousin he didn't even know that well.,1-1
16,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,"Grandma's little sister had moved to Beijing early on, got married and had kids there.",1-1
17,这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"This cousin of Dad's was her eldest son, and he didn't fit into our clan at all.",1-1
18,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"Earlier on, you said everyone has a moment when their fate is activated, and after that they're being led around by a rope.",1-1
19,我的应该是在八岁。,"For me, that probably happened when I turned eight.",1-1
20,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,Dad left Jinan in the fall and traveled alone to Beijing.,1-1
21,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"From then on, I had no home.",1-1
22,我并不打算赴约。 不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,I hadn't planned to show up—I didn't think we had any need to meet again.,2-1
23,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。 送,I sat on the couch and smoked cigarette after cigarette as it got dark.,2-1
24,水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,Then someone tapped on the door: the water delivery boy.,1-1
25,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,He wore a filthy gray wool hat and looked harried.,1-1
27,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,It was a difficult conversation.,1-1
28,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time we fell into silence, I felt something squeezing at my heart, and I wanted to end this encounter as quickly as possible.",1-1
29,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seemed to sense this, and searched for something else to talk about.",1-1
30,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"The tea cooled, the fog dissipated. You stood to leave.",1-2
31,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,I'd only just closed the door and sighed in relief when the bell rang again.,1-1
32,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。 我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,You said I should come to the white mansion later and walked away before I could respond.,2-1
33,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I went to the kitchen and turned off the stove.,1-1
34,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"Half the water had boiled away, filling the room with fog.",1-1
35,你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。,You sat and watched anxiously as I made tea.,1-1
36,"""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？"" 你问。","""Are you still living with your grandma and aunt?"" you asked.",2-1
37,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"I told you Granny was dead, but yes, I was still with Auntie.",1-1
38,"""她一直没成家"" 你问。","""And she never married?""",1-1
39,"""嗯。""","""No.",1-1
40,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"Your breath came white from your mouth. The wind had tangled your curly hair, and your knees were trembling under your coat. All these things told me you were actually there, and this wasn't just a continuation of the dream.",1-3
41,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,"I hadn't seen you in eighteen years, no wonder I couldn't recognize you.",1-1
42,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。 只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"You weren't wearing makeup, and your pale face looked a little swollen, but it was clear you'd grown into a beauty like we'd all known you would—though you had the numb expression of someone who's been in the big city too long.",2-1
43,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,You asked if you looked how I'd imagined.,1-1
44,我不置可否地笑了笑。 坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,I smiled and admitted I'd never imagined you grown up.,2-1
45,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"As far as I was concerned, you and everything to do with you had been placed into a sealed folder.",1-1
46,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"Maybe this is hurtful to hear, but I had truly never hoped to meet you again.",1-1
47,我睁开眼睛。,I opened my eyes.,1-1
48,你站在门囗。,You were in the doorway.,1-1
49,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。 还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,"I didn't know how long you'd been there. Had you seen me laughing from the dream, then my sadness when I woke, when I was at my most vulnerable?",2-2
50,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"You said my name in a soft, raspy voice, as if you hadn't spoken for a long time.",1-1
51,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,The sky was dark—about to snow.,1-1
52,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,The boiling water rumbled.,1-1
53,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。 可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"I looked carefully but didn't know who you were, yet I felt this stranger standing in the gloom had a deep connection to my life.",2-1
54,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,The thought chilled my spine.,1-1
55,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。,I frantically flicked through the Rolodex of my mind.,1-1
56,然后你说，你是李佳栖。,You told me you were Li Jiaqi.,1-1
