1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing that happened to me was my father's return. He came back just a week before my mother's wedding.",1-2
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"On a cold afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me.",1-1
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。,"I ran towards the school gate, my heart racing with excitement. From afar, I saw him standing outside, smoking a cigarette.",1-2
4,身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"He was wearing a black overcoat, and his collar was turned up, covering half of his face.",1-1
5,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"I don't know why, but even his appearance seemed strange and unfamiliar.",1-1
6,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"My heart ached, and tears streamed down my face.",1-1
7,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I never thought my mother would remarry.,1-1
8,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me.",1-1
9,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。,"Moreover, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness.",1-1
10,事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"However, in reality, happiness may have found her instead.",1-1
11,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"After all, as a beautiful woman, she didn't need to work hard or do much; she could simply stand still and be fine.",1-1
12,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"I still remember that winter, which seemed to last forever. It was already mid-April, and the spring flowers had yet to bloom.",1-2
13,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,The news of my parents' divorce had left you feeling down.,1-1
14,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We hadn't had any new games in a while, and every evening we would sit on the rooftop of the death tower, feeling listless.",1-1
15,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,"In the courtyard, there were more and more discarded body parts.",1-1
16,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,We used hooks to gather them up and arranged them into a thousand-handed Guanyin.,1-1
17,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,"My father didn't have much of a clue about doing business, he just went to work for a distant relative who wasn't very familiar to him.",1-1
18,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,My grandmother had a younger sister who went to Beijing early on and later got married and had children there.,1-1

20,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"""Just as you said, everyone has their own time of luck, and life is like a roller coaster.",1-1
21,我的应该是在八岁。,Mine was when I was eight years old.,1-1
22,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,"That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.",1-1
23,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"From then on, I never had a home again.",1-1
24,我并不打算赴约。,I don't plan on going to the appointment.,1-1
25,不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,"Whether it's because of something or nothing, I think we don't need to see each other again.",1-1
26,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。,"I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, watching the sky gradually darken. Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the door.",1-2
27,送 水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,"The boy delivering water stood outside, holding a water tank and saying he had brought water for a household in the west suburbs.",2-1
28,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,He wore a dirty gray woolen hat and had a dazed expression.,1-1
29,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,Our conversation was going on with great difficulty.,1-1
30,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart was being compressed, and I just wanted to quickly end this meeting.",1-1
31,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seemed to have noticed, but you were still trying to find a topic to talk about.",1-1
32,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the house had already dissipated.",1-1
33,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,"You finally got up to leave, and I just closed the door, feeling a sense of relief.",1-1
34,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。,"The doorbell rang again, and you stood at the door, asking me to come to the small building later.",1-1
35,我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,I hadn't even had time to decline when you had already left the building.,1-1
36,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.,1-1
37,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"The water had already boiled half a pot, and the entire room was shrouded in white mist.",1-1
38,"你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？"" 你问。","You sat down and watched me pour tea, asking, ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?""",3-1
39,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt.",1-1
40,"""她一直没成家"" 你问。","""She never got married,"" you asked.",1-1
41,"""嗯。""","""Yes,"" I replied.",1-1
42,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the wind-tossed strands of hair on your forehead, the subtle tremble of your knees under the hem of your dress these convince me that the you before me is real, not a continuation of that dream from long ago.",1-1
43,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,"Eighteen years have passed, and it's no surprise that I don't recognize you.",1-1
44,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。,"You haven't put on any makeup, and your pale face has a hint of puffiness, but you've still exceeded everyone's expectations and grown into a beautiful woman.",1-1
45,只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"That small, delicate face of yours still has a trace of the past, a hint of the city's hustle and bustle.",1-1
46,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,You ask me if your appearance is different from how I imagined it.,1-1
47,我不置可否地笑了笑。,I can't help but smile wryly.,1-1
48,坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,"To be honest, I've never thought about what you'd look like after growing up.",1-1
49,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"For me, everything related to you has been locked away in a drawer, sealed with lacquer.",1-1
50,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"Perhaps saying this might hurt someone's feelings, but I really haven't been expecting to see you again.",1-1
51,我睁开眼睛。,I open my eyes.,1-1
52,你站在门囗。,You are standing at the door.,1-1
53,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。,"I do not know how long you have been standing there, perhaps you even saw me laughing in my dream.",1-1
54,还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,"Also the sadness of waking up, and how I look in my weakest moments.",1-1
55,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"Cheng Gong, you softly call out my name, your voice is very hoarse as if you have not spoken for a while.",1-1
56,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,"It's about to snow, the skies are seriously overcast, it's pitch black in the room.",1-1
57,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,The water on the stove is boiling and bubbling away.,1-1
58,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。 可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"After observing you carefully for a moment I am certain that I don't know you yet somehow under this dim light suddenly,I felt like this stranger opposite me has a deep connection with my life.",2-1
59,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,This feeling sends chills down one's spine.,1-1
60,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。 然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"Thinking hard then memories started flipping hastily through mind and thenyou said,""I am Li Jiaqi"".",2-1
