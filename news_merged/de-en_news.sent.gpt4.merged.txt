Diego Cocca becomes new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, featuring for the first time 48 teams. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not considered among the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused upset within the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) are setting up plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The initiative "Geesthacht Blooms" also includes information about what is currently blooming there in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht "Geesthacht is blooming" is a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. Goal: Extensive flowering islands are to be created in the Geesthacht city area, where insects can find food at all times. "In favorable weather conditions, bees already fly out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He has bee hives on the property himself.
In order for this endeavor not only to be an action by conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also to spread far and wide into private gardens, explanatory signs about the plants are repeatedly put up. About 50 signs have been made so far. This way, passers-by can inform themselves about what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately replant at home.
The wild hazel season had already started in the first week of January.
Shrubs such as winter-flowering cherry and winter snowball, of recent origin, are in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone. They have now been in the ground for a year, the tubs on Bergedorf Street, just showing their first delicate blossoms in white and pink without leaves, and were recently adorned with more signs. "The winter daphne is a very bushy shrub and can grow up to two meters high and three meters wide", can be read there, among other information about the suitable location.
The wild hazel season had already started in the first week of January. Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the garden plants are now showing flowers. The wild hazel season had already started in the first week of January.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looks down from heaven to Munich's East Station!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at exactly 3 p.m. at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively tap dance. Together they are an incredible 277 years old, or rather young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd. Birthday.
For the native-born Munich woman (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. Dancing and stepping are my life, I can't imagine without it.
Ernestine is also hitting the dance floor with Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79).
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, she worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. I've spent my life dancing, acting, and singing.
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the baby of the group among the tap dancers. She says: "We simply have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dance was established in the 19th century. Developed in the USA in the century and is known worldwide today. With a pair of metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that match the visual impression and the music. Thus, the dancer also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeically "Tap dance" and the French one is "Claquettes". The Spanish flamenco could have influenced tap dancing. In this process, the tips of the shoes are nailed so they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at East Station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. We are a large family, where both young and old, big and small are welcome.
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Their advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol".
Analog in Dialogue: The Limits of the Digital
With advancing digitalization, some people are rediscovering their desire for analog.
The rapid pace at which our everyday life became digital left us hardly any time to establish rules for handling it and adjusting our methods of communication and work, believes DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If one wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one belonged to the six percent of lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call to relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or one would look for a phone booth. Unforgettable is the smell of the plastic receiver and the clinking of small coins in the vending machine. My greatest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when making a call. Video telephony, I thought, what a wonderful thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean was one of the advisors to the president.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself stated in explanation for her resignation. Apparently, she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "tremendous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, since it holds 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet is therefore not expected to pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian ones have become more popular with support from the Kremlin.
Those were the celebrities' costumes.
There will be a proper celebration again in Veitshöchheim in 2023. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't wait long to join in.
Regional father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume would suggest. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. By his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich along with his wife Anja.
Completely spaced out: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to outer space.
President of the State Parliament Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the model for her costume.
In Peace-and-Love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek along with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's Golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during Carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side, wife Gerswid.
On the road: Minister of Economics Hubert Aiwanger honors craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
The political opposition, of course, could not be missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party Faction Leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her Co-Chief Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian Lion.
Hiking is the joy of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal for FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he definitely talks more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was out and about as a mime. By his side, Mrs. Andrea.
If politics does not work out anymore, he can still do magic. Nuremberg's Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermine.
Buzzing about as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister, Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small swipe at the climate activists by Franconian Tatort-Commissioner Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be missing either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn Eighth in World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite challenging conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to close the gap on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 world championship gold medals. Even partially heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already managed to successfully defend their title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Boe is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain degree frighteningly easily.
Meanwhile, nothing was coming together for Doll. After the veteran had squandered all chances of a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty lap at the start and ended up only in sixth place, things did not get any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in the prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated his greatest success in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago by a slim margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career-successes for Doll, who so far this winter stood on the podium once. The eighth-place finisher at the Beijing Olympics left wordlessly after his poor performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, while the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the primary focus is on the value of democracy. Both are looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit from his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been tested," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that form the core of our strength." Lula replied, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1st. The transfer of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in Brazil's capital, Brasília, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil ominously recalls the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington. 1. 1.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not care much about international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied, an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press of Friday.
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? It showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were designated for denunciation and elimination.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred against the most dangerous enemies of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say of bourgeois democracy, let's say of late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgart Newspaper, which usually chases after hooligans in the subways or public masturbators in the park, is issuing a new edition focusing on "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong there might be more "friends of Russia" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, rather: Ms. Wagenknecht is in positions 1 to 5 (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my vicinity anymore who reads this paper. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level where there is nothing below it.
(And here, no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There it says: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for the dissolution of his civil partnership through his family lawyer at the relevant court. I will not comment on the details.
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there have been rumors of a breakup for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also talked about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. Moreover, he contributed to the German-French peace. The survivor had, among other things, advocated for German-French youth encounters.
A curve layout for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series Northern Lippe Hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, up to 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup, with some even making the same trip back.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation rate. The inflationary risks remain high. "The costs for energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag".
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the Eurozone for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and indicated a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16th. The prime interest rate in the Eurozone is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can curb demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher credit interest rates can also lead to investments being postponed, thus weakening economic growth.
Rising interest rates are a burden for heavily indebted Eurozone countries such as Italy. "The consequences of a persistently high inflation are significantly more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we need to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at an inflation rate of two percent. This target mark has been far away for months. In January, the price surge weakened again, however, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can afford less for one euro. Significantly increased energy prices, which are driving inflation significantly, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" for infrastructure projects announced by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). There will need to be a political and social dialogue about this. "And he might also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge, with which it doesn't necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals that were put into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries to some extent. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke on the occasion of a new "Germany pace". Furthermore, the federal government recently initiated a process to speed up approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. "But that should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must always be a negotiation process about what we as a society find right and wrong.
In the past, they tried it with the classic set of rules and didn't succeed. We should reconsider whether our previous approach was really the right one. Perhaps we have exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.
Given the many pending tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.
Union warns of dismantling the Bayer Group
The Chemical Union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the conglomerate after an announced leadership change at Bayer. "From the perspective of the employees, Bayer, with its three pillars, is correctly positioned to meet future challenges," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board member, to "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The reference is to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter drugs, and the agricultural business. The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk diversification and sustainability, not hedge fund activism.
The background is the announced change of leadership at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company on Thursday. The controversial head Werner Baumann will step down from his position later this summer. The former pharmaceutical chief of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The manager is still dealing with the aftermath of the 2018 acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate upon themselves. The Bayer stock had been in a downward spiral for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the general meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann was not seeking to extend his contract, which was originally intended to run until 2024. Long-term oriented strategic investors had put pressure. Lastly, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the corporation.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. "A spin-off of the Consumer Health division could be a potential way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to protest against pension reform.
Paris
The French plan to protest against the planned pension reform again on Saturday.
The unions are opposing a government project with massive protests in the streets. Hundreds of thousands plan to protest against the pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets again on Saturday, wishing to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the centrist government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years old. Twice already, over a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been ongoing in the parliament for a week over the controversial reform.
Already now, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid into their pension for long enough to qualify for a full retirement without deductions. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work any longer, opponents of the reform believe. Moreover, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to cover an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population needs to work a bit more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, it's not only the retirement age that the government wants to adjust. The previously decided increase in the necessary deposit duration for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is supposed to increase to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron made efforts with varying success to reform the French pension system, all of them certainly faced widespread protest and strikes.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, they are hoping to pass the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. Some of the deputies, even from Macron's faction, still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, at the moment Macron is likely to be concerned about crippling strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could rely on the organizers' sense of responsibility, so that these would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected in high altitudes with lots of sun.
A powerful high pressure area is located over Central Europe and is determining the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
Offenbach In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. Indeed, this high will shift a little to the east over the course of next week.
However, quiet high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. Such a high can even be quite nasty and bestow people in the lowlands with dreary high fog grey for days on end, while there is pure sunshine in the higher elevations of the mid-range mountains.
The Sunday starts foggy and overcast in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it could still rain a bit according to the DWD. Above all at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and parts of the west, the cloud cover loosens up throughout the day and the sun comes out more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily overcast or covered with high fog. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist. At the edge of the Alps, in the high-altitude regions of the central mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day long, elsewhere it first has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures range from 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected in the Lower Rhine area, but only around 3 degrees are anticipated in the constant gray of the southeast. A weak wind is blowing from various directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may once again only be slow clearing of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather appears clear after the fog has lifted. According to forecasts, the sun is expected to shine all day in high-altitude areas, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps. The temperatures climb to between 5 and 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Yet again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia showed great disappointment after her elimination in the downhill event of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform as well as I could have," said the Italian woman on ZDF, after she had tangled at a gate and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill racer in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, known for her risky driving style, must continue to wait for a World Championship medal in her favorite discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
Méribel I actually thought I was in a good mood. "It was a matter of hundredths of a second," Goggia said, following the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. I am disappointed. I gave it everything. But that's life.
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?

Zelensky and Ministers against Russia's Olympic Participation
Paris Kiev.
In a joint teleconference, it was agreed to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the United Kingdom. The meeting was very productive, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. And I have made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this topic.
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Due to the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and unbearable.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also views Belarus as a party to the war, because the country provides military bases for Russian forces to launch attacks. Zelensky urged officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that they wish to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine also threatens with a boycott, should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
Paris The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sports subsequently stated that it had reiterated in the consultations its rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes starting in Paris. From our perspective, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unrestricted solidarity and support of the international sports community.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum. Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. The IOC, however, is striving for the return of female and male athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "due to a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.

Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank stock greatly diminished
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank reserves greatly diminished.
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a considerable number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. The talk is about the "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates from the US Department of Defense. "Approximately half of the main tank fleet" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates at an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The United Kingdom has promised to deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks to Kiev in March. Germany plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April in a coalition with other nations. The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, your delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to step up.
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitri Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for airplanes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks.
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a stronger orientation of the economy towards the needs of the army. This allows for certain industries to be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army position appointment
Because the position, which the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM), Christian Ortner, will assume in the future, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects office corruption and abuse of power. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the course of action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously unoccupied position, said the minister. She does not wish to comment on the "speculations of a liberal personnel representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying. These have been cleared up from Tanner's perspective.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's substantive suitability. This person is an expert on World War I and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision gives the "appearance of jobbery," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos demand Tanner to withdraw the appointment. "The ÖVP is still 'up to its neck in the swamp of corruption'," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the topic.
Carnival: First fools buckle under the cost
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security and other things are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the estimated total costs for the move.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, likely again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. Even at the Swabian-Alemannic Carnival, no parades were cancelled.
Despite the increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But financial worries also weigh heavily here: If they don't find more sponsors, or if the current ones don't contribute more, reserves would have to be dipped into "that can't happen every year". The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: There has been a price increase of up to 60 percent for some confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association. Due to a stroke of luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. Despite the move, it has already been determined that it will become more expensive. Twice as much staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
Those who stand along the route of the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland might receive fewer sweets than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train passengers don't have as many with them. Regardless of the candy, visitor turnout is expected to be high: "I believe if it doesn't rain buckets on the day, then we can certainly expect a large crowd," says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular Rose Monday parade for two years. The train is naturally irreplaceable by anything.
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. The train is generally "deficit-ridden", this is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
Ukrainians are not wrongly considered to be heavy drinkers. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not a Kulmbacher, but other big breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't discern a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely distributed. They primarily burn it here themselves, especially in the villages. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had dropped an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little one can trust the Russians. It is said that one should be careful with it as a tourist. But that only applies if it goes into mass sale. There will probably be tampering then.

Eating and Drinking
Who wants to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or a Those who wish to drink beer after work can find great locations for it in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetups or pre-drinking for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championship: Federal President witnesses favorite's victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and Oberhof's mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the World Championships sprint in Oberhof. But there were two glimmers of hope in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the grandstand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, referring to the foggy clouds that kept rolling into the stadium and significantly impaired the view at Rennsteig for spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel. "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports venues. "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say this with thanks to those who have stepped up since the World Cup was awarded here. In terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others, making it "secure for the next few years and even decades."
Oberhof Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö outpaced the competition in sports. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes, thus achieving his second World Championship title in Oberhof. 1.
The local ski hunters could not compete for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimmers of hope behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs standing this time and disappeared as number 55. 4.
Bö had started the race as number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and maintained this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, on his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the skillful; they each landed on the edge of the targets and still went down. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory ceremony with his brother, who is five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes". 4.
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. For the women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. If you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. "There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," sports director Felix Bitterling challenged his "locomotive". The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 hrs/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the field
Referee Felix Brych decides on a drop ball.
Aggressively approaching players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee Chief Fröhlich points out a role model function.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in cooperation on the field. "I do believe that there are new behaviors from the players, who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "We discussed this during the winter break." We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behaviors. We will pay closer attention to that in the future and will also impose sanctions.
Lastly, two coaches were also given dismissals. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson saw the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg's coach Christian Streich received a yellow-red card in the league defeat at Dortmund. The behavior of the coach also falls under unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behaviors have also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. "We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike behaviors," said Brych.
DFB Referee Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a generally good cooperation between coaches and referees. Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with that. "That shouldn't be earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
Conflicts can indeed arise from emotionality during the course of the game. "But when the emotionality spills over into personal slander, it must also be accepted that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, those involved have sorted things out afterwards. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking as a whole were to begin, that such behavior is simply not appropriate," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible impacts at another level. Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There exists a role model effect, from which imitation results. "In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent rule interpretation during the game, a clarifying conversation, involving an exchange of perspectives between referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combiner Oftebro triumphs in Schonach
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and a ten-kilometer cross-country ski race, ahead of the overall leader from Austria, Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia came in third.
The German combined team will not be competing in the Black Forest with their strongest line-up. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not participating. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from the 21st. February to the 5th of March in Planica, Slovenia. We have three world-class athletes at home. "Of course, the team feels this," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF. 1. 1.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district). According to a police report, a rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during light traffic and pushed it into two other cars. The full closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
Initiated the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, 12. In February, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Sculpture Museum. For the finale, there are some extras.
The closing event for the "Wall-bound" exhibition will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3pm in the temporary quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Street 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals draw attention in each.
After the exhibition, the walls are repainted, the artworks disappear. A catalog, however, documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum. He will be introduced by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag, on February 12th.
At the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art serving the community. Using numerous illustrative examples, she presents the peculiarities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and inquires about the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who received her doctorate in 2013 on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art and the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It concerns construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in the south of Turkey following building collapses during the earthquake, due to possible construction defects. Warrants have been issued against 33 individuals in the city of Diyarbakir, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, referring to law enforcement authorities. The accused are alleged to be responsible for building defects that would have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said. According to the information, one of the accused was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He is reported to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. According to reports, nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another quake of magnitude 7.6 at noon. More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow has passed away, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died in the night from Friday to Saturday. Parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch honored the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
"Last night, Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is thus losing "a significant figure," stated the parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi.
Dresden. In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st. Secretary of the District Leadership of the Socialist Unity Party in Dresden. As the Prime Minister, he presided over the end of East Germany. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. 1.
The parliamentary leader of The Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed.
The entire peaceful process of the unification of Germany was particularly due to his merit. "That will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. The text continues:
His later work in the People's Chamber, Bundestag, European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population who were unwanted and whose interests were regularly violated.
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically". The German unity was carried out too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and it was too one-sidedly condemned as a "rogue state," Modrow criticized in many interviews according to dpa.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kyiv The latest wave of Russian missile attacks again forces emergency repairs to the Ukrainian energy network. But Ukraine also attacks Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of energy provider Ukrenerho, Wolodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
Paris President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror.
Zelensky will not abandon the small town of Bakhmut.
War has been raging since February 24th for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The threat from Russian missile attacks nevertheless continued into Saturday night. In the capital city of Kiev, an air raid alarm was triggered for the fifth time on late Friday evening. "An attack with drones is threatened," announced the military administration of the Kiev region. Combat drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south. 4.
German Railways: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands, including those of the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign, to spin these off, failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise had been reached on the creation of an infrastructure company, which should however be oriented towards public welfare in the future. That means, she does not need to generate and distribute profits.
Backlog of renovations worth 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the federation with overseeing this process. The backlog of repairs in the rail network is a major reason why the train is currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to remedy this problem by fully renovating entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have been estimated so far at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
Apparently, the external circumstances had not spoken in favor of Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", her pulse had not come down even during the warm-up. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championship, "you cannot describe with words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team embraced each other. 1.
"Enjoy biathlon", that was what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick is the only German who has won two World Cups this winter. Currently, she ranks fifth in the overall World Cup. And even though the level of performance among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, other participants were expected to win this sprint race.
Criticism of the Government: Bishop in Nicaragua Sentenced to 26 Years in Prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. The relationship between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church has been severely strained since 2018. Back then, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country over the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special funds
First armament projects have therefore already been canceled, and the same threat hangs over further plans, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". The specific investments that would be eliminated cannot be determined at this time. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential savings requirement at this point in time," says the Federal Government's response to a query from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the declining investment amount is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which was fully financed by credit and decided upon by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest costs for the loans itself. If these increase, therefore, less money is available for specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 Injured
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 AM, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to take the highway ramp at Kupferzell towards Heilbronn onto the highway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as reported by the police. During the turning process of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles. 1.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system found no faults. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, as well as the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars sustained a total material damage of approximately 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is also great in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members heeded the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's prayer solemnly and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for assistance for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. He prayed, among other things, for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other. The community also requested support and strength to "bring our aid to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and in Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The supplications were also translated into German in the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is strong. Several million euros have already been raised in the fundraising campaign of the German Islam Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting material donations on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. The willingness to help there was also overwhelming.
Hike with Meat Insert Ebersberg
"After the meal, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The older ones know this saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. One way or another, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestion walk has experienced an unforeseen renaissance. Because those who, thanks to home office, are not situated in the middle of a stone desert but rather only a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as an alternative for a walk in the fresh air. At least that's the impression one could get around Lake Egglburger, where between 12 and 2 pm, it's not only dog owners who are gathering.
One reason could naturally also be that modern humans, in the course of optimal time slot usage, can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things. Because why not learn news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor during a short march through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never manage to go to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? In this way, it's also possible to combine work and private life - who says that appointments with tax advisors, lawyers, or financial advisors can't take place outdoors? Assuming there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be excellently accomplished is the acquisition of natural history specimens. Fresh fruit, for example, that stands next to a small box on a table at the roadside. Or potatoes and meat. It's just unfortunate when one hasn't considered the purchase beforehand and taken appropriate precautions. Thus, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leave the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voice. Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money.
The disappointment is understandable, having indeed a companion with a wallet, but not possessing a transporting container. What one lets the friendly chance acquaintance also know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You definitely have a bag with you!" In doing so, he points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly threw on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes any additional head cover unnecessary. My wife always packs everything in there!
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat accompaniment and, on this short midday excursion, not only gained a lamb's back, but also an extremely practical idea. It's quite possible that a second walk will be necessary on this day after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and for unknown reasons veered off the road to the right in a left turn, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guidepost, hit a tree sideways, and came to a stop some meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency service transported the severely injured person to a hospital. Since there was suspicion of driving impairment, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. According to the police report, the Audi was completely totaled with damages amounting to 1000 Euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the tax returns of the former president to the parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as the President of the USA.
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the Ministry's decision on Friday.
In contradiction to political customs in the USA, the real estate businessman Trump did not publicly disclose his tax return either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted up to the Supreme Court against a release. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, however, no details from them could be made public unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of those authorized to access is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the course of the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the parliament.
The Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax documents is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi stated.

British hardened criminal caught in Thailand after long escape.
After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from the UK has been caught in Thailand. As announced by the British criminal police NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most sought after by the NCA.
The leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before a court trial, according to authorities. In absentia, he was sentenced to eleven years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines valued at eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and claims to love Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. This fits well with the programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits well with the prevailing domestic skepticism of science is debatable. His humor certainly fits very well in Vienna.
By the way, the English title also derives from Ebert's more recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what science actually is and what it can do, and above all what it cannot do. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering skills.
And he boils it down to the most important question that many people postpone: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, relaxed and very ironically. And so, not only will you be well entertained, but you can also learn something new.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the view of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tanks, as well as nimble rockets that become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended course of the game. Additionally, UFOs appear at regular intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game sequence, the initial input for high scores and the self-test sequence. The latter mode of operation represents a specific sequence for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
Gameplay The game sequence is triggered when the pressure switch START is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. If the last player's tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of their cockpit. In addition, a point is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, representing the enemy's position. Course of the game
The upper, conical surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the underlying screen. If the opponent is in this area, they can be easily targeted on the screen. ENEMY IN FIRE RANGE is also continuously displayed in the upper left advisory display.
1. Gameplay Occasionally, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the combat action and can eliminate neither the enemy nor the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are supposed to round off the combat action and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy tank. A shoot down by the player earns them 5,000 points. When an opponent is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or a slow-moving enemy tank. Several options allow the player to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks in a game sequence. Additionally, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be unlocked and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design.  Course of the game
5. Initial input at maximum results
Gameplay If a player exceeds the minimum score in the high score table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game ends. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that by initiating a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone analog vector generator PCB, or interrupting the main power supply, the table of top results will be deleted. When resetting, the top ten (10) high scores along with their initials are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge further players. Every score that exceeds 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will automatically be entered by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. Course of the game

The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI joystick. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this assembly unit more stable and ensuring the proper function of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellow, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the middle position. The microswitches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC Boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit was extended over two (2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board. Through the use of this switching technology, more lines are produced on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a uniform and calm image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly constructed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device includes a console intended as a platform for smaller players to facilitate playing. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should carry out a certain review to complete the quality control. To ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V power supply. A. Inspect the outside of the case for damages. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for proper and secure connection. Potential open or
NOTE: Never forcefully make plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a forced guidance system to ensure a correct connection is made. A 180-degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the gaming PC board for correct and secure fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the embossed manufacturing number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, Control/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the manufacturing number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console, and TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a glance through the player's sight glass, it should be checked whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-encircled opening of the casing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the casing attached with adhesive tape must be detached and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selection plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? The following is a list of tips that may help you resolve most problems associated with current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time and check whether your system meets the requirements listed on the package. With the help of the DirectX diagnostic tool, you can get an overview of your system if you are unsure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please proceed as follows to call up the DirectX diagnostic program: Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Enter "dxdiag" into the text field. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs take over the system resources needed for the game to run smoothly. Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program freezing or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before starting the game. If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or deactivate them before you start the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). As soon as you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as these can sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly. Then the chances are high that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of working much more efficiently, thus making other applications you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the tools ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation, and disk cleanup. The use of Windows Help
1. 1. 1. Click the "Start" button and choose the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to call up Windows help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk cleanup". 1 1.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This way, you can often prevent a game from crashing or freezing. First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Following is the list of the most recent graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a wealth of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. She represented an opportunity for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century. Century ago: On the one hand, I was struggling with the yet undeveloped technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover, especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and thus forgot about a fundamental element of human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid advances. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying emotions. Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that one can indeed create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to obtain ammunition, but also possesses far more sophisticated and profound content. It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit contributes to changing your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to yet discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles previously considered immutable. I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit, like books, films, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you, also doesn't pass by you without leaving a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
Gameplay Course of the game By pressing the corresponding start button, the game starts for one player or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. An attempt must be made to cover a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game play is set up so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before one can tackle the next area (round). The temporally controlled SPARX are displayed at the top of the screen by red timing lines. When the red lines converge, additional SPARX are released. During an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If you hesitate and do not finish your area, a fuse will be lit and your marking will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. The 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming Display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) used for address programming and the game is selected. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language appears in green, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment Programming With this display, the difficulty level for the game can be determined. Furthermore, it can be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be in place before the game begins. The inscription to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), and the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" button. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory can. The basic setting can be achieved when the bottom line (RESET line) is glowing green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (also called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required score/hit count a player needs for their own initials (names) and hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum credit" sets a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the limit is exceeded, if a coin lock is present, the coin acceptance is locked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that credits could become zero by inserting a coin if more than 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Credits" to zero. Additional Programming: "Number of games": Number of marking signs per credit
"Threshold": Height of the percentage number that must be reached in order to switch to the next pass.
"Time Limit": Approval for Additional Sparx
Gameplay Course of the game
"Alarm volume": at "0" no sound in standby mode
at "1" sound even in standby mode (animation sound) "table model": at "0" stand-alone device

1.  The credits per coin are set on the "coin slot programming" display. High-Score-Program-Display (Highest hit rate so far) The player's scoring points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score, which was selected on the previous display (setting of "back"). By pressing the "Up" button, the QIX standard initials are set. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total Credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear as 0 when the battery or the W1 plug connection are removed, with the device switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted into the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Counted loans: Number of loans granted for inserted (converted coins). Granted Loans: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Spins: Granted Credits (Paid + granted credits per 100) Played Minutes: Number of minutes that were played. Minutes gained: Number of minutes in extended or won game. % Leisure: Minutes won/minutes played per 100. Average game duration in seconds: Minutes played / paid + granted loans
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Drop slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the stand operator can choose a standard coin setting or program a different setting.
If a standard setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" button while the top digit glows green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. Upon reaching the correct setting by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that personal setting is possible. Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" buttons can be used to increase or decrease the values. The process is terminated by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units "credit" indicates the number of required units before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (storage) FAILURE
When "Memory Failure Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default settings. This condition probably indicates a battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display, by pressing the "Test" button, the next program will always be displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice in order for the video test to begin in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is shut down. When the message "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the programming plug J 19, 1 2 must be inserted. When the J 19 plug is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware Tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of every video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If a difference is present, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum of ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Video Board's Communications RAM
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct. LED Value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the above-mentioned. A fault has been detected in the display. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may be caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: errors in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. Once the test is passed, all memory locations are reset to their previous value. LED Value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above mentioned display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy upon re-reading. LED Value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these registrations are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, diagnose the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it will show that the next test is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functioning.
Unfortunately disappointed
1.  The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for Star No. 1. The 2nd one to ensure that the right jacket arrived without any visible seam defects. BUT I must have been too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was even greater. I ordered the jacket in size L based on the other reviews. Since it's supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle into a small or medium with my bust size... In the end, it would have fit lengthwise and at the waist...in the rest I could swim. Moreover, the feed material came out as soon as the package was opened and spread everywhere. Just a shame..
Fast delivery and good craftsmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good craftsmanship. You can comfortably wear them on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears size 158 and in this case, size 36 fits her quite well and will surely be worn for the next year too. We can recommend an order.
Robust Quality
I chose the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack, and it's not ideal. Unfortunately, I made a mistake in measuring and the pad doesn't quite fit. But what is my mistake. Then slightly modified it so that it fits. The pad appears very sturdy and no longer damages the edges. You can use the nut or the entire surface. Worked without problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, however not under one year. Since the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size. Now, at 12 months old, we have found it again and he can use it. Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his few existing teeth. And when he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately going back
I suppose I allowed myself to be dazzled by the partly gushing reviews here. I would like to preface by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you on the go. Having just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. I purchased this backpack on Prime Day for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, came the disillusionment: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, one can't deny that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... People, that's simply not true! I was really hoping that it was so, but there's absolutely no way you can say that. The padded walls are significantly thinner and do not provide the same level of protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more flimsy. Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro. Even the zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back. If I invest in equipment costing several thousand euros, unfortunately, I also have to spend money on a decent backpack. Quality apparently does have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here, one can certainly find their items much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, this backpack is certainly a great thing. However, I will be returning mine.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part.
So far, I liked the Electricity series by E. L. Todd the best, however my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books to be very powerful and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part. In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and then acts like a little child in every fight and retreats?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor had a crush on him. He tried to convince the ex that Taylor could not live without him and that he himself had heard it. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will read the fourth part anyway and hope that it finally comes out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring back more tension into the story.
God Human destroys everything, appreciates nothing and learns nothing! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many people say. Sure, of course the story is totally contrived, and repeatedly designed according to the same blueprint. If you've seen the beginning, you know what the ending is like. And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and never learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often during the movie I just thought (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, those poor animals, it often brings tears to my eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that people simply don't get the message behind the movie, despite it being a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of habit and greed, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: nonexistent. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise it could have been 5 stars. Still well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a movie like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't aim to be one either. This film is primarily "French" and it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and brings one to tears if you surrender to it and expect nothing from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Afterwards, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediately stopping it, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately seen too late), while the larger one received a full 5? This is very very strange!
Terrible stench and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair a deep chocolate brown in October, then used this hair color remover in February/March. I have used the product twice. The first time, I immediately noticed that it smells terribly! However, there was still not a too bad result, it turned out to be approximately chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it one more time, as the instructions also suggested for unsatisfactory results. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked like after the first attempt. The very worst part was, it still stunk for weeks after the application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a while now due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional prolonged illness. I wanted to help boost my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2. This works in a very good way too. I feel fitter and significantly more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed more easily. The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
Function not quite flawless !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following severe defects which I find very disturbing: 1) Over time, the case has had problems "connecting" with the phone. This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. When you remove the cell phone from its case and reinstall it, you can solve the problem in 70% of cases. However, this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequently removing and reinserting the phone into the case, the cover has worn out so much that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many major defects, I believe that a battery case should function flawlessly, and therefore, for the cost of 30€, I am very disappointed with the product. This is especially because I have only been using it for three months.
Way too expensive, too thin and disappointing.
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift in a slightly smaller form from any optician. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better. I expected much more from these cloths, they are indeed very, very thin. Since I've used it, I unfortunately can't exchange it anymore. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my point of view. The price for these wipes is far too high, one should not pay more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller complimentary speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. In general, the Onforu works great, it's waterproof (it has already fallen into the shower), delivers bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. it can play sound very loud... yes.. what I critically see is the frequency response of this small speaker. As said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the song almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just barely audible. My old speaker may not have reproduced bass sound well, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume. Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct a star for this. I just expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places, the paint had chipped off and just running one's hand over it caused the paint to come off in some spots. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but how if both dressers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded us the money. A praise to Amazon
Better spend a bit more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which one has to glue together themselves. The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the mailman crammed the product into my mailbox, a few templates got damaged. I did not complain because I urgently needed this product. The included adhesive barely holds, but it sticks properly like chewing gum which, however, does not harden. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive does not dry (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one must be very careful that everything does not stick together. The templates are partially unstamped. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay. However, for a wedding, I would invest more money and opt for a high-end product.
Not dissatisfied. The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not very clear. + Magnetic closures + Attractive appearance + Stable when assembled + Shelf can be positioned as desired
Doors slam due to magnets (could possibly be counteracted with rubber knobs) some spots are unclean.
The supplied wall plugs are too small and wobble (I didn't have any others, and since there was no trophy in the house, I glued them with craft glue). The brackets for the shelf are also a bit wobbly (I wrapped some paper around it to stabilize it). Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit in order to be truly satisfied. Moreover, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the taste of the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee is not running through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a one star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and scores full points soon.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are awful, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was still too loud for me, it would instantly knock me out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately, you cannot dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time do not need to be reset in case of a power outage. But returned for the aforementioned reasons.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I have replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four because the other two were delivered without a mount, instead a circuit board is staring at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "Get 4 for 6" is not a good deal. Amazon probably would have resolved this graciously and quickly, but I only noticed it after the return deadline. So I see that as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indicator of the quality of these light bulbs so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color tends more towards cool white. Perfect for the hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc. For living spaces, I personally would opt for warmer light. Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. Other lamps can do the same, however, and perhaps I will also receive intact specimens according to the order there. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first impression. Yes, positive. I've spent a long time debating whether to order this set or not. The material is stable and it feels good in the hand. All the utensils have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up. The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots, and is particularly practical to use on coated pans. They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. They also do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly. However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But shortly after wiping, they are gone. Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend.
B-Stock Sold as New Stock
Amazon Prime shipping simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. During this, we found out that the part had already been installed once before. On all Monday shares, we had to notice significant scratches and abrasions. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (Unfortunately). Only now did we see that there are also scratch marks / streaks visible on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This item has probably already been delivered and returned. We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a bit more at the hardware store where we get decent products. I just find it sad that customers are being cheated like this!!!
Product itself is top-notch, unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very straightforward, and the radio range is also very good, with no problems at all with transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after approximately. It seems that the thermometer is still intact, it continues to display plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, appears to be broken, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values for the outdoor humidity. That is very unfortunate, since the device was installed outdoors in a protected location and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with weak catch basket
Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service was as always outstanding with initiating a replacement delivery. The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression. The engine is powerful and it results in a nice cut image. The volume is not impressively low, but it's okay. The big downside is unfortunately the catch basket. For one, it is made of hard plastic only at the top and bottom, with fabric in between. If you only briefly put it down when it's full, of course it gets compressed and parts of the content fall out. However, what is worse is that the supposedly practical fill-level indicator already shows red when the catch basket is only half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cut material from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it's only half full can't be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Essentially a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catcher renders it useless for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated through the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if needed. The device is solidly constructed. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed one to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I am only giving 4 stars. The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is somewhat tricky to close again. One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses its network connection every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even when placed near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it will reconnect. That should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. The alarm sound could be a bit louder. Very good
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed correctly. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened yet the hotbed is still too high, and on the front right, the screw is practically falling out since it's not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the car are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because as it is, it's impossible to print anything. Regarding the setup: The assembly was quite trouble-free, one could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response. Unfortunately, returning it is no longer possible. I had expected a bit more.
Robust and precise, I am pleasantly surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one appears to be very robust and is equally precise according to several test measurements. Included are two batteries, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but it fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give full points for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. From me, there is a clear buying recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and haven't worn it yet, as it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, even though it has been "aired out" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Advise against purchase
Okay for the price
The stars and spheres on this chain are personally a bit too large for me, making it look quite bulky. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is overall very simply constructed, so I've already torn open the clasp twice. So far, I have been able to repair it over and over again, but I think that this will not last/hold up for long. But for the low price, you simply can't really expect anything of high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds! One simply needs to pull the end through the mouth, it cannot open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care product, which makes it even softer and more supple. Only: those who have something magnetic on their arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was disappointed right after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the impression that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some fiddling.... if one follows the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I had removed a battery from the base station and inserted a new one, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about this didn't last long, because just after one hour the connection was lost again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, it's not usable for me like this! The thing went back! Would certainly advise against a purchase, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Transport damage Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off. I only bought them again for one reason, I needed them urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit. I hope that the fault in the previous pump was a production error and that the current pump will last a bit longer in its service. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was damaged on the outside as well, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box.
Could have been thought through better. Since I frequently deal with many different keys, I thought that having an organizer would be more pleasant than always walking around with a huge bunch of keys. At first, everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws had to be tightened frequently. Nice that it also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I could not find a suitable flathead screwdriver that would not have immediately ruined the entire screw. Now, to get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes through the various parts. Once everything is screwed together, however, one should have a pair of pliers at hand to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance, and skill. Eventually, while assembling for the third time, the screw broke off in the thread, rendering the whole thing useless. Conclusion: If at all, then only once for all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material seems robust and all of this at featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after its first use. I can already tell you in advance that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine being able to do everything there, for example. In case of emergency, the really large parts can be put directly in the suitcase as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller pouches/bags. Not high-quality craftsmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that is ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked. Battery? Exchanged. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the trash can as well.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush not to damage the needle. I could not discern an improvement in sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life lasts a very long time. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
stylish dress
Very beautiful dress, which is well wearable for the most diverse occasions. The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended). I just wish that the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could also use a bit more fabric (if one doesn't have quite as slender upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It can't get any worse. I really and sincerely did not expect that such garbage is sold nowadays. The drive is operating on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, it is not possible for this drive to operate without disruptions. DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at best. The discs need to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes rattling noises like those you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it's not getting any better, or the disc will finally be recognized. Then you must not press pause under any circumstances, skip to another chapter, change the language during the movie, or do anything else at all. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If one buys PowerDVD or similar payable additional software, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First and foremost, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually a deception because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that at the time of purchase, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly would not have bought this unwieldy lump with golden plugs. But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And because of the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around, as it would with a regular extension cord. So not really a bad purchase, but my enthusiasm is quite limited :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also shuffle data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I also had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to the tablet and the HDMI is connected to the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. This doesn't fit with the adapter with my case. Well, it holds securely and has contact, so... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdily made in a piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Plenty of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly easy or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle setting of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool, so I always have it on level 2. It has already fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products sometimes do look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. During operation, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and they can be recommended without reservation.
Great
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the location tracking seems to be accurate to approximately 0.5 meters. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does like to jump a few meters occasionally, which however is not bothersome. I would buy it again anytime. However, what would be great is a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days. Here would be a great solution that could last 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version, unfortunately it's too large for our taste. We wouldn't need the battery to last that long and we also find changing it daily to be inconvenient. One should engage with the dog, not with its collar :-). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of trash
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable too. However, the lifespan is increasingly decreasing. Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair, it was the same in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be sufficient for the class. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair. Unfortunately, these here appear to be poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly finished and the heel strap is rather loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I have placed it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) on a trial basis. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that this doesn't reappear. A lying test was conducted immediately in the inflated state. It's comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace one's own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Before, we removed the seats from the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The Air Pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in crafts, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the excellent piece worked superbly and inflated the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I'm excited then for the acid test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and also lasts a long time. Similarly, that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them already. If I should have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
1.  very bad Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars. 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar tore open across several doors on day 1 due to sloppy craftsmanship. On the 21st door, there were no little doors left, and I had to more or less allow my son that he can accordingly also take out the remaining parts, since they practically already fell out towards him. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that the car has to be taken apart again in order to replace the parts. After the car is fully assembled, parts come off while playing. (Mainly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach. Personally, I would not buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.
a real drone
I am fascinated by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it. Inside, it flies very well and the 5 minutes. Flight times are usually completely sufficient. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly given the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether on tile or carpet, are not a problem. For questions, nice contact.
Game okay but only playable with compulsory Steam. I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it's not a game CD, but only a code that can be used to download the game. That would be fine so far, but one is forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is an outrage. Ever since then, the computer has been constantly freezing, which would certainly not be the case with a clean installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without problems. The operation worked well... and yet I'm sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just laid on the shelf overnight, and 11% less battery in the morning despite not being used. If many messages came during the day, the battery was already dead by noon/early afternoon and then you can't even tell the time anymore. Therefore, not usable for me. Very unfortunate.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case. I recently liked cases where you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much and the lid stands somewhat high. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a sturdy impression and seems to be well made. She looks noble. The cell phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, with cutouts only at the ports. Otherwise, the power switch and volume controls on the sides can be easily operated through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the TORRO leather QI charging station it doesn't work. Accessories like the Galaxy Buds can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
High-quality case with tempered glass film
1.  A robust case with a real armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone.
