1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my father returned, a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to find me at school. I rushed all the way to the gate only to see him standing outside smoking a cigarette and looking through the iron railings from afar. He wore a black trench coat with an upright collar covering half of his face. For some unknown reason, I sensed he was not doing well even without getting a clear look at him and that brought tears to my eyes."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I believed she should continue to feel pain due to my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt she lacked the ability to find happiness again. While this may have been true, happiness had the ability to find her. After all, as a beautiful woman, she did not have to make much effort; all she needed was simply stand still and let things happen around her."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that year's winter was exceptionally long. Halfway through April, and the jasmine had not yet bloomed. Our parents' divorce had you in such a low state. We didn't have any new games for a long time, and at dusk we would sit aimlessly on the roof of the tower of the dead. Amongst the body parts strewn around our yard, there were several more arms than before. Using hooks and sticks we gathered them together to form something that resembled Thousand-Handed Guanyin (a statue form of Buddha)."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"Actually, my father knew nothing about doing business. He was just trying to work with a distant cousin whom he didn't know well. My grandmother had a sister who had moved to Beijing years ago and later married and gave birth there. This cousin was her eldest son, who has always been considered an outlier in our entire family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You mentioned before that everyone has a time when their fate seems to suddenly be reined in. I think mine was when I was eight years old. In autumn of that year, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. Since then, I haven't had a home anymore."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I had no intention of keeping the appointment. Whatever the reason, I thought there was no longer any need for us to see each other again. Sitting on the sofa chain-smoking, as it got darker and darker, there was suddenly a knock at the door. The water delivery boy stood at the entrance with his water bucket, saying he was delivering water to a household in the western suburbs. He wore a dirtied grey woolen hat and looked absent-minded."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Each silence made me feel a tightness in my chest and I could only think of ending our meeting as quickly as possible. You seemed to sense this but continued to try and find topics of conversation. As the tea cooled down, the vapor in the room dissipated, you finally stood up to leave. No sooner than I had shut the door and exhaled a sigh of relief, did the doorbell ring again. It was you, standing at my doorstep asking me to visit Xiao Bai Lou later tonight. Before I even had the chance to decline your invitation, you had already disappeared out of sight down the stairs."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half of the water had already evaporated, filling the entire room with a foggy haze. You sat down uncomfortably and watched as I poured tea. ""Do you still live with your grandma and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that grandma has passed away and now it's just me living with my aunt. ""She never got married?"", you questioned further, to which I responded simply,""Yes.""."
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath coming out of your mouth, your curly hair ruffled by the wind, and the slight tremble in your knees beneath the hem of your coat all convince me that you're really here before me now, not merely a continuation from a previous dream. It has been eighteen years; it's no surprise if I can't recognize you. You haven’t put on makeup—your pale face is slightly puffy but at least you haven't disappointed everyone by growing up to be beautiful. Although, that heart-shaped face is cloaked in gloominess—revealing an expression typical of someone who's lived in a big city for too long. You asked me if you looked different than what I imagined. I just smiled ambiguously because truthfully, I had never imagined how you would look all grown up. For me, everything related to you has already been filed away and sealed with wax—which might sound hurtful—but honestly speaking, I didn't have any expectations to see you again."
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You were standing in the doorway. I didn’t know how long you had been there-- probably long enough to have seen even how I laugh in my dreams, the sorrow upon waking, and my appearance at its weakest moment. Cheng Gong, you whispered my name, your voice gruff as though you hadn't spoken for a very long time. It was about to snow; the weather was getting worst and it was pitch black inside our house. The water on the stove boiled with gulping sounds resonating throughout the room. I looked closely at you for a while - decidedly sure that I didn’t recognize you but under this dim light, something told me this stranger standing before me had deep ties with my life. It’s a creepy sensation that sent chills running down my spine. Racking through different cards of memories swiftly in my mind but found nothing related to your face until finally; then you said: ""You are Li Jiaqi""."
