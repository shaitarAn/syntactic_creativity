1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"The most significant event for me in the winter of 1993 was the return of my father, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to look for me at school. I ran as fast as I could towards the main gate and saw him from a distance - standing outside smoking beyond the iron fence. He was wearing a long black trench coat, with his collar up hiding half his face. For some reason, though I couldn't see his face clearly, I felt that he seemed to be doing not so well. A wave of sadness washed over me and tears started falling from my eyes."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. Maybe it was true, but happiness had the ability to find her. After all, as a beautiful woman, she didn't have to strive so hard; she didn't have to do anything but simply stand still where she was."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember that winter that year was particularly long, with the spring blooms not appearing even after half of April had passed. The divorce of your parents had sunk you into a gloomy mood. We hadn’t come up with any new games for a long time and would listlessly sit on the rooftop of the Dead Man's Tower every evening. Among the body parts scattered across our yard, there were a few more arms than before. Using hooks, we gathered them together to form a Thousand-Arm Guanyin."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father, in reality, had no idea how to do business; he only went to seek the help of a distant cousin who he didn’t know very well. My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing when she was very young and later married and had children there. This male cousin, as her eldest son, always existed as an anomaly within the whole family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You just said that everyone has a time when their life takes off, as if they are suddenly harnessed. For me, it should have been when I was eight years old. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. Ever since then, I've never had a home again."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I didn't plan to keep the appointment. No matter what, I don’t think there is any need for us to meet again. Sitting on the couch, I smoked one cigarette after another, as darkness fell. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. The water delivery boy stood at the entrance with a bucket of water in his hands, saying he had been delivering water to a family in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty gray wool hat and had a vacant look on his face."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very strained. Each time we fell into silence, I felt a pressure on my heart and just wanted to end the meeting quickly. You seemed to notice but continued trying to find topics of conversation. As the tea cooled and the white fog in the room dissipated completely, you finally got up and said goodbye. The moment I had shut the door and felt relief wash over me, the doorbell rang again. It was you standing at my doorstep, inviting me to come over to Xiao Bai building later on in evening. Before I even had a chance to refuse, you had already disappeared from sight down the stairwell."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the whole room was filled with white mist. You sat down uneasily, watching me pour tea. ""Are you still living with your grandmother and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that my grandmother had passed away, now I live with my aunt. ""She never got married,"" you ask. ""Yes."""
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath you exhale, the curls in your hair stirred by the wind, the trembling of your knees beneath your coat hem—these things convince me that you standing before me is real and not a continuation of a previous dream. We haven't seen each other for eighteen years, so it wouldn't be strange if I didn't recognize you. You're not wearing make-up; your pale face has a bit of puffiness, but at least you have lived up to everyone's expectations and grown into a beauty. It’s just that that peach-shaped face looks gloomy, carrying an expression of having been in the big city for too long. You asked me if your appearance is different from what I imagined. I simply responded with an indifferent smile. Honestly speaking, I have never imagined what you would look like once grown up. Along with everything related to you was placed inside file bags and sealed with wax lacquer as far as I'm concerned. To tell it bluntly might hurt – but truly speaking, I had no intentions or expectations to meet you again whatsoever."
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You were standing there at the door. I didn't know how long you had been standing, perhaps you have seen me laughing in my dreams, as well as awake and mourning, at my most vulnerable moments. ""Cheng Gong,"" your voice was really hoarse when you softly called out my name; it seemed that you hadn't spoken for a very long time. It is going to snow soon; the sky was so overcast that the room was dark. The water on the stove boiled, bubbling and rolling over itself. I looked at you carefully for a while and made sure that I did not know who were are; yet in dim light, I suddenly felt this stranger standing across from me seemingly has a deep connection with my life which sent chills down my spine.I tried hard to remember with memory cards flipping through in mind.Then, you said,you are Li Jiaqi."
