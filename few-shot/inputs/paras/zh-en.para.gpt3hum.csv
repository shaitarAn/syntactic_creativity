1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my dad came back, just a week before my mom got married. On an afternoon in December, he came to the school to find me. I ran towards the front gate and saw him standing outside smoking from afar. He was wearing a black overcoat, with the collar turned up covering half his face. I don't know why, but even though I couldn't see his face clearly, it seemed like he wasn't doing well. My heart felt sour and tears fell from my eyes."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarriage. Perhaps subconsciously, I believed that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me. Besides, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. The truth may indeed be as such, but happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't that right? As a beautiful woman, she shouldn't have to work so hard and do anything at all; she could just stand in one place."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that winter was particularly long. Halfway through April and the welcoming spring flowers still hadn't bloomed. The divorce of your parents caused you to feel very down. We hadn't had any new games for a long time, so every evening we would sit lazily on the roof of the dead tower with nothing to do. Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were a few more arms and we used a hook to gather them together, arranging them into a Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father was actually clueless about doing business, he just went to seek refuge with a not so familiar cousin. My grandmother had a sister who left for Beijing early on and later got married and had children there. This cousin was her oldest son, and he had always been an outsider in the entire family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now, you said that everyone has a time of good fortune, and it seems like life suddenly becomes restrained. Mine should have been when I was eight years old. In the autumn of that year, my dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. Since then, I have never had a home again."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I had no intention of going to the appointment. Whatever the reason, I didn't think we needed to see each other again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. The sky was getting darker and darker, when suddenly there was a firm knock on the door. A boy delivering water stood at the doorway, holding a bucket and saying that he was delivering water to a family in the western suburb. He wore a dirty gray knitted hat and had a dazed expression on his face."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was difficult. Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being squeezed and just wanted to end the meeting quickly. You seemed to sense this, but still made an effort to find a topic to talk about. The tea had gone cold and the white mist in the room had dissipated when you finally got up to say goodbye. Just as I closed the door and felt relieved, the doorbell rang again. It was you standing at the doorstep, asking me to come to Xiaobailou later. Before I could even refuse, you had already walked out of the doorway."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white vapor. You sat down nervously and watched as I poured tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt. ""She never got married,"" you asked. ""Hmm."""
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath that exhales from your mouth, the tousled hair stirred by the wind, and the knee that slightly trembles beneath the hem of your coat - these make me believe that you before my eyes is a real existence, and not a continuation of the previous dream. It's not surprising that I wouldn't recognize you after 18 years without seeing each other. You're not wearing makeup; your pale face is slightly swollen, but at least it lives up to everyone's expectations - you've grown into a beauty. However, with that melancholy expression on your heart-shaped face, you look like someone who has spent a long time in a big city. You ask if this appearance of yours is different from what I had imagined. I smiled without giving an answer. To be honest, I've never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. As far as I'm concerned, everything related to you has already been filed away and sealed with wax. Perhaps it may hurt someone if it's said out loud, but truly, I never expected to see you again."""
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You were standing by the door. I didn't know how long you had been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my dream. And the sadness that woke up with me, how weak it was in those moments. Cheng Gong, you whispered my name, your voice was very hoarse, as if you hadn't spoken for a long time. It's about to snow, the sky is so dark and gloomy, and the room is pitch black. The water on the stove is boiling, bubbling and rolling. I looked at you carefully for a while and confirmed that I didn't know you. But in the dim light, suddenly I felt that this stranger standing across from me seemed to have a deep connection with my life—a feeling that sent shivers down my spine. I tried hard to remember; memory cards were flipping through my mind with a clatter-clatter sound . . . then you said: You are Li Jiaqi"
