Translate the following text from Japanese into English.\Japanese: ミホとサツキは地元で頻繁に会っているせいか、そっくりな表情と喋り方をしている。特にお菓子の食べ方が似ていて、二人ともネイルを施した手でクッキーを小さく割りながら口に運んでいる。前からそうだったろうか、と思いだそうとするが、記憶が曖昧だ。前に会ったときの二人の小さな癖や仕草は、もうどこかへ流れ出て行ってしまったのかもしれないとも思う.

Miho and Satsuki often meet in their hometown, and they have similar expressions and speech patterns. They both eat cookies in a similar way, using their nails to cut the cookies into small pieces and then feeding them into their mouths. I thought that was the case before, but my memory is hazy. I wonder if the small habits and gestures of the two when they first met have already disappeared somewhere.
