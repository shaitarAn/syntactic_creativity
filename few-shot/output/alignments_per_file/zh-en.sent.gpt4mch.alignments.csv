1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"The most significant event for me during the winter of 1993 was the return of my father, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to the school to find me. I ran all the way to the main gate, and through the iron bars, I saw him standing outside smoking from afar. Wearing a long black trench coat, with the collar turned up to cover half of his face. I don't know why, but even without seeing him clearly, I felt that he was not doing well. My heart ached, and tears came streaming down.",3-10 4-25 5-7 6-8 10-2 11-3 14-16 15-13 17-17 18-18 19-22 20-23 21-26 22-21 24-20 25-27 26-31 28-28 29-29 30-32 31-33 32-35 33-37 35-39 36-40 37-41 38-42 40-43 42-47 44-50 45-51 47-48 48-56 53-61 54-62 55-63 56-64 57-65 59-68 61-70 62-71 63-73 64-72 67-78 72-77 73-86 75-87 77-90 78-91 79-96 80-97 83-103 85-101 86-102 90-107 91-109 94-104 96-111 97-114 98-115 99-116 100-117 103-122 106-126
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought my mother would consider remarriage. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I feel she lacks the ability to find happiness. Perhaps that is indeed the case, but happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't that so? As a beauty, she didn't have to work hard at all. She didn't have to do anything - just standing there was enough.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-7 7-9 11-10 12-11 13-12 14-13 15-14 16-15 17-17 18-18 19-19 20-23 21-26 22-28 23-31 25-20 26-22 28-32 29-34 30-35 32-36 34-38 35-39 36-41 37-42 38-44 40-48 41-49 42-46 43-50 45-51 46-54 47-72 48-57 49-58 50-59 51-60 52-62 53-64 54-65 55-66 56-70 59-74 60-76 61-77 65-85 67-78 68-96 70-93 71-95 73-98 74-99 76-100 78-103
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, the winter of that year was particularly long, and by halfway through April, the spring blossoms had not yet bloomed. The divorce of your parents has made you very depressed. We haven't had any new games for a long time and would aimlessly sit on the roof of the dead man's tower every evening. Among the various body parts scattered in the yard, several more arms had appeared. We hooked them together to form a statue of the thousand-armed Guanyin.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-7 4-8 6-5 7-10 8-11 9-12 10-18 13-15 14-19 17-25 18-27 19-29 21-37 22-34 25-39 26-36 28-41 29-42 30-44 31-32 32-46 35-51 36-52 37-53 41-17 42-77 48-63 49-64 50-70 51-71 53-73 55-67 56-65 57-78 58-91 60-89 61-87 64-82 65-83 67-84 69-92 72-93 75-95 76-98 77-99 82-102 83-100 85-103 88-105 90-111 94-117
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father actually had no business acumen; he just went to join a cousin who he was not very familiar with. My grandmother had a younger sister who moved to Beijing at an early age and later married and had children there. This cousin is the eldest son of her family, and he has always been considered an outcast within the whole family.",0-0 1-1 2-2 5-5 9-7 10-8 11-10 12-11 13-13 15-14 16-19 18-21 21-15 22-23 23-24 24-27 25-28 26-32 31-36 33-42 34-47 35-43 38-48 39-49 41-50 42-51 43-57 46-55 47-59 48-70 49-71 50-58 51-69 53-63 54-65 55-67 56-68 58-73
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You just mentioned that everyone has a time when their luck changes, as though life suddenly gets reined in. I think I was eight. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. Since then, I no longer had a home.",2-2 3-4 4-5 7-7 8-12 9-15 11-16 12-19 16-21 20-26 22-27 23-28 26-31 27-32 28-34 29-35 32-42 33-39 34-41 35-43 36-44 37-45 39-46 40-47 41-49 42-50 43-52 45-53
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I don't plan on keeping the appointment. Regardless of the reason, I think there's no need for us to meet again. I sat on the sofa, puffing one cigarette after another. The sky grew darker and darker, when suddenly there was a knock at the door.

He was wearing a grimy gray woolen cap, his expression vacant.",0-0 1-3 2-4 4-8 5-9 6-10 7-14 9-15 10-17 11-24 13-27 14-26 18-28 19-29 20-30 22-33 23-31 28-38 30-43 32-44 35-60 36-53 37-35 40-57 43-41 47-65 50-75 51-77 55-78 56-79 57-85 58-90 60-86 62-87 63-82 64-84 66-93 67-94 68-96 70-74 76-100 77-102 79-105 81-108 84-109 85-111
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Each time I fell silent, I felt a pressure on my heart and just wanted to end the meeting quickly. You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic to talk about. The tea had cooled, the white fog in the room had finally cleared, and you eventually got up to take your leave. Just as I closed the door and let out a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again. You stood at the door, asking me to come to the White Building later. Before I had a chance to refuse, you had already left the building.",1-0 2-1 4-3 5-4 6-5 7-6 8-9 9-10 10-11 12-13 13-18 15-15 18-21 19-26 21-23 22-24 23-25 24-27 25-28 26-29 29-32 30-34 31-35 32-39 33-40 34-42 35-44 37-50 38-52 40-54 41-60 44-56 45-57 49-65 50-67 51-62 57-78 59-79 61-81 62-90 64-63 69-92 70-93 71-95 72-94 74-96 76-98 79-102 80-103 81-104 82-111 84-107 85-108 86-109 87-110 89-112 95-119 97-120 98-97 99-123 101-100 102-126 104-127
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家"" 你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half of the water had evaporated from the pot, filling the entire room with white mist. You sit down uncomfortably, watching me pour tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?""

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath you exhale, the curl of your hair ruffled by the wind, your knees trembling slightly beneath the hem of your coat - these make me believe that you are real, and not a continuation of a dream I had before. It's been eighteen years, so it wouldn't be strange if you didn't recognize me. You didn't wear any makeup, your pale face was slightly swollen, but at least you lived up to everyone's expectations and grew into a beautiful woman. But her small, peach-shaped face was gloomy, emanating a demeanor of having spent too long in the metropolis. You asked me if you look different from what I had imagined. I smiled noncommittally. To be honest, I've never imagined what you would look like when you grow up. For me, everything related to you has been put into a file bag and sealed with wax. It may hurt to say this, but honestly, I did not look forward to seeing you again.",3-4 5-1 7-2 14-15 16-12 17-19 22-27 23-26 24-24 25-25 27-21 28-34 29-35 30-36 31-38 32-39 36-43 38-44 39-46 40-42 41-55 43-52 44-105 45-49 46-56 47-61 48-63 52-64 53-77 57-71 58-79 59-80 60-83 61-84 62-86 63-87 68-92 69-126 70-94 71-95 72-96 78-103 79-106 80-107 81-108 82-110 83-111 84-113 86-115 91-117 92-90 97-129 102-140 105-135 106-145 107-146 108-147 113-153 116-152 117-159 123-161 129-217 131-172 132-175 133-176 134-177 135-194 136-185 139-187 142-190 144-192 146-191 147-195 148-197 149-198 150-200 151-201 153-203 154-204 156-206 157-207 158-212 160-209 161-162 163-210 166-214 167-215 168-171 170-221 173-226 174-227 175-225 176-228
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I open my eyes. You are standing at the door. I don't know how long you've been standing there, you might even have seen me laughing in my dreams. There's also the sadness upon waking up, looking my weakest. Cheng Gong, you whispered my name, your voice so hoarse, as if it had been a long time since you’ve spoken. It's about to snow, the sky is terribly overcast, and it's pitch black inside the house. The water on the stove came to a boil, bubbling and rolling. I looked at you closely for a while, certain that I did not know you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing across from me seemed to have a deep connection with my life. That feeling sends chills down one's spine. I tried hard to remember, the cards of memory flipping through my mind.
