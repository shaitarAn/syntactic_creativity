1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my dad came back, just a week before my mom got married. One afternoon in December, he came to the school to find me. I ran all the way to the main gate and saw him standing outside smoking, separated by the iron bars. She was wearing a long black windbreaker, with the collar raised to cover half of her face. I don't know why, but even without seeing his appearance clearly, I felt like he was not doing well. My heart felt a pang, and tears welled up in my eyes.",3-4 5-1 6-2 7-5 10-8 11-9 14-15 15-17 17-18 18-19 19-23 21-26 22-22 24-21 25-27 26-31 28-28 29-29 30-32 31-33 32-35 33-37 35-39 36-40 37-41 38-42 40-43 42-47 44-50 45-51 47-48 53-52 54-53 55-54 56-55 57-56 59-66 61-69 63-72 64-71 67-76 68-81 70-78 71-79 72-75 73-83 75-84 76-85 77-87 78-88 79-93 80-94 83-100 84-101 85-98 86-99 88-95 90-105 91-107 94-102 96-109 97-112 98-113 99-114 100-116 102-103 103-121 106-128
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like I did. Besides, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness. The truth may indeed be so, but happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't it true? As a beautiful woman, there's really no need for all that hard work. She doesn't have to do anything at all, just standing in one place is enough.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-7 10-10 11-11 12-12 13-13 14-14 15-15 16-16 17-18 18-20 19-21 20-25 21-28 22-30 23-33 25-22 26-24 28-34 29-36 30-37 32-39 34-41 35-42 36-44 37-46 38-48 40-52 42-50 43-54 44-56 45-57 46-58 47-60 48-61 49-62 50-63 51-64 53-68 54-69 55-70 56-74 59-78 60-81 61-82 62-86 64-91 65-93 67-95 68-102 69-87 70-88 71-101 72-105 73-106 74-107 78-113
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that winter was particularly long that year, halfway into April and the winter jasmine flowers had not yet bloomed. The divorce of your parents made you feel very low. We haven't had any new games for a long time, so we would sit idle on the rooftop of the Tower of the Dead every evening. In the yard, among the scattered body parts, there were a few more arms. We use hooks to pull them together and form a Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-9 4-10 6-5 7-7 8-8 9-11 10-15 13-12 14-16 17-22 18-24 19-26 21-34 22-31 25-35 26-33 28-38 30-39 31-29 32-41 35-46 36-47 37-48 39-53 42-71 49-57 53-61 55-63 56-60 57-72 58-75 63-78 65-83 67-84 71-90 72-89 75-91 76-92 77-93 78-94 79-95 80-96 82-99 83-98 85-100 86-85 88-102 89-103 94-115
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father was actually clueless when it came to doing business; he just went to seek refuge with a distant cousin whom he wasn't really familiar with.

5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Earlier, you mentioned that everyone has a time when their luck starts, as if life suddenly put on a bridle. I should have been eight years old. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. From then on, I no longer had a home.",2-4 3-7 4-8 7-10 8-16 9-19 11-20 12-21 15-25 16-26 18-28 20-31 21-32 22-34 23-35 26-38 27-39 28-41 29-42 30-48 32-49 33-46 35-50 36-51 37-52 38-53 39-54 40-55 41-57 42-58 43-60 45-61
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I do not intend to keep the appointment. Whatever the reason might be, I think there's no need for us to meet again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. The sky was getting darker, and suddenly there was a loud knocking at the door.

He wore a dirty gray woolen hat, with a vacant expression.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 6-9 7-12 9-15 10-17 11-24 13-27 14-26 18-28 19-29 20-30 22-33 23-31 27-35 28-37 30-42 32-44 33-45 34-47 35-59 36-49 43-40 47-63 48-64 49-65 50-67 51-69 52-70 56-75 57-82 58-87 60-83 62-84 63-80 64-81 66-90 67-91 70-66 72-95 75-72 76-97 77-99 78-98 79-102 80-103 85-109
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was progressing very difficultly. Each time I fell into silence, I felt my heart being oppressed, and I just wanted the meeting to end quickly. You seem to have a sense but are still trying to find a topic. The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the room had dissipated. You finally got up and bid farewell. As soon as I closed the door, I felt a sense of relief, but then the doorbell rang again. You stand at the door and ask me to come to Xiaobailou later. Before I could refuse, you had already walked out of the corridor.",1-0 2-1 3-3 4-5 5-6 6-8 7-9 8-12 9-14 10-15 12-17 13-19 14-20 15-22 17-24 18-28 21-32 22-29 23-30 24-34 25-35 26-36 27-38 31-41 32-43 33-44 34-46 35-48 37-51 38-54 41-63 42-62 44-58 45-60 47-65 49-55 51-70 56-49 59-82 60-61 61-84 63-87 69-96 70-97 71-99 72-98 74-100 75-69 76-102 77-105 80-107 81-108 84-111 85-112 89-116 90-86 95-120 97-121 98-122 99-124 100-125 101-104 104-131
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家"" 你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist. You sat down awkwardly, watching me pour tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?""

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath escaping your mouth, the wind tousling your curly hair, the knees trembling slightly beneath the hem of your coat—all these make me believe that you, standing before me, are a real presence and not just a continuation of the dream from earlier. Haven't seen each other for eighteen years, so it's not surprising that I couldn't recognize her. You aren't wearing makeup, your pale face is slightly swollen, but you haven't let anyone down; you've grown into a beauty. But her peach-shaped face looked desolate, with an expression as if she had been in the big city for a long time. You ask me, ""Is your appearance different from what I imagined."" I smiled noncommittally. To be honest, I have never imagined what you would look like when you grow up. As for me, everything related to you has already been packed into a file bag and sealed with wax. Revealing it might hurt someone, but I really didn't anticipate meeting you again.",1-6 4-4 5-1 10-9 14-13 15-14 16-15 17-16 22-24 23-23 24-21 25-22 27-18 28-31 29-32 30-34 31-36 32-37 33-41 36-47 37-48 38-44 40-45 41-59 42-56 43-57 45-54 46-60 47-69 48-71 50-65 53-84 57-78 58-86 59-87 60-90 61-91 62-92 63-93 66-96 70-100 71-101 72-102 75-83 78-108 82-116 83-117 84-118 100-144 102-147 106-149 107-150 108-151 110-111 111-157 113-159 114-162 116-158 117-164 123-166 126-172 127-175 130-176 131-177 132-179 133-180 134-181 135-199 136-189 139-191 142-195 144-197 145-142 146-196 147-201 148-203 149-205 150-207 151-208 153-210 154-212 156-213 157-214 159-217 160-219 162-98 163-220 164-221 166-222 167-223 171-229 173-232 174-233 175-231 176-234
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You are standing at the door. I don't know how long you have been standing there. Maybe you even saw me laughing out loud in a dream. And the sorrow upon waking, the appearance of weakness at its most vulnerable moment. Cheng Gong, you called out my name in a low voice, your voice extremely hoarse as if you hadn't spoken for a long time. Snow was about to fall, the sky was dark and gloomy, and the house was pitch black. The water on the stove boiled and bubbled noisily. I looked at you carefully for a while and was sure that I didn't know you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite me seemed to have a deep connection to my life. That feeling sent a chill down my spine. I tried to remember, the memory cards in my mind flipping and flickering.
