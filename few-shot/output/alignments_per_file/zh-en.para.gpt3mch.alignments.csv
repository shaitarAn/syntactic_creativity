1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In that winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my father came back, just a week before my mother got married. On an afternoon in December, he came to the school to find me. I ran towards the gate and saw him standing outside smoking, through the iron bars. He was wearing a black overcoat with the collar standing up, covering half his face. For some reason, even though I couldn't see his face clearly, I felt like he wasn't doing well. My heart ached and tears fell from my eyes.",3-4 5-1 6-2 7-5 10-8 11-9 14-15 15-17 17-18 18-19 19-23 20-24 21-26 22-22 24-21 25-27 26-32 28-29 29-30 30-33 31-34 32-36 33-38 35-40 36-41 37-42 38-43 40-44 42-45 44-47 45-48 46-55 47-46 48-58 53-49 54-50 55-51 57-53 59-61 61-64 63-66 66-69 67-76 71-72 72-73 73-77 74-78 75-79 77-81 78-82 80-85 81-86 83-94 85-92 86-93 90-99 91-101 94-96 96-106 97-107 98-108 99-109 100-110 101-111 103-114 104-115 106-119
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mom would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I believed that she should continue to suffer because of my dad's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. And yet, happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't that right? As a beautiful woman, she doesn't have to work so hard at all. She doesn't need to do anything and just needs to stand in one place.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-4 4-5 5-6 6-8 10-11 11-12 12-13 13-14 14-15 15-16 16-17 17-19 18-22 19-23 20-27 21-30 22-32 23-35 25-24 26-26 28-36 29-38 30-39 32-40 35-43 36-45 37-47 38-49 42-51 49-57 50-59 51-60 52-62 53-64 54-65 55-55 56-70 58-58 59-74 60-77 61-78 64-86 65-87 67-79 68-98 69-94 70-95 71-97 73-100 74-103 76-106 78-107
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that year's winter was especially long. Half of April had passed and the welcome-spring flowers hadn't bloomed yet. The divorce of our parents made you feel very down. We hadn't had any new games for a long time, so every evening we would sit on the roof of the dead man's tower with nothing to do. Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were several more arms. We used a hook to gather them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-7 6-8 7-10 8-11 10-15 12-17 13-13 14-18 17-23 18-27 19-28 21-37 22-34 25-38 26-39 28-41 30-29 31-32 32-44 35-50 36-51 37-52 39-57 42-60 49-63 50-69 51-70 53-72 55-66 56-64 57-79 58-91 59-92 60-89 63-82 65-87 67-88 69-93 72-96 75-98 76-99 77-100 78-101 79-103 82-107 83-110 85-108 88-113 89-114 94-125
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father actually had no knowledge of business, he just went to seek refuge with a cousin who he wasn't very familiar with. My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing many years ago and got married there.

5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now, you said that everyone has a time of good luck, and it seems as though their life is suddenly being restrained. Mine should have been at eight years old. That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing on his own. Since then, I have never had a home again.",1-1 2-4 3-6 4-7 7-9 8-13 9-20 10-16 11-22 13-26 16-27 17-28 18-21 20-33 21-34 22-36 23-37 26-40 27-41 28-42 29-43 30-49 33-47 35-53 36-54 37-55 39-56 40-57 41-63 42-59 43-62 45-64
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I had no intention of keeping the appointment. Whatever the reason, it seemed unnecessary for us to meet again. I sat on the sofa, smoking cigarette after cigarette. The sky grew darker and darker when suddenly there was a knock at the door. The water delivery boy stood there with a bucket, saying he had come to deliver water to a household in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty gray woolen cap and had a vacant look in his eyes.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 6-9 7-12 9-13 11-21 13-24 14-23 18-25 19-26 20-27 21-30 23-28 27-32 28-33 30-38 32-39 35-54 36-47 40-51 43-55 47-59 50-57 51-65 52-60 55-66 56-67 57-74 58-79 62-76 63-72 64-73 66-82 67-83 68-84 70-86 72-87 75-78 76-89 77-91 78-88 79-94 81-100 85-104
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was difficult. Every time silence fell, I felt my heart being oppressed and just wanted to end the meeting quickly. You seemed to sense it, but were still trying to find a topic of conversation. The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the room had dispersed. Finally, you got up and said your goodbyes. Just as I closed the door and let out a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again. It was you, standing at the doorstep, asking me to come to Xiaobailou later. Before I could even refuse, you had already walked out of the doorway.",1-0 2-1 5-3 6-4 7-5 8-8 9-7 10-9 12-11 13-13 14-14 15-16 16-17 17-18 18-20 19-25 21-22 22-23 23-24 24-26 25-27 26-28 29-30 30-32 31-33 32-35 33-36 34-38 35-40 36-43 37-45 38-48 40-49 41-57 43-55 44-52 45-54 46-46 50-65 51-63 56-62 57-77 59-78 60-79 61-80 62-64 69-91 70-92 71-94 72-93 74-74 76-100 79-105 80-106 81-107 82-114 84-110 85-113 86-112 89-115 95-120 97-121 98-122 99-124 100-125 101-102 102-103 104-131
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. The water in the kettle had evaporated halfway, and the whole room was filled with a white mist. You sat down uncomfortably and watched as I poured tea.

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath coming out of your mouth, the curly hair blown by the wind, the slight trembling of your knees under the hem of your coat—these make me believe that you are a real presence in front of me, not a continuation of the previous dream. It's been eighteen years since we last saw each other, so it's not surprising that I couldn't recognize you. You're not wearing any makeup and your pale face is slightly swollen, but at least you haven't disappointed everyone's expectations—you've grown into a beauty. But your heart-shaped face looks melancholy, giving off an air of someone who has spent too long in the big city. You asked me if you look different from how I imagined you would be. I smiled without giving a definite answer. To be honest, I have never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. As far as I'm concerned, everything related to you has already been filed away and sealed with wax. It might hurt if I were to say it out loud, but honestly speaking, I never expected to see you again.",1-7 2-5 4-3 5-1 6-31 7-2 13-14 14-13 16-12 17-18 22-29 24-22 25-23 26-24 27-26 28-35 29-36 30-38 31-40 32-41 36-46 37-47 38-52 39-53 40-44 41-59 42-58 43-60 44-116 45-56 46-61 47-66 48-68 50-72 53-87 57-81 58-89 59-43 60-93 61-94 62-96 65-11 66-134 71-105 72-106 78-114 79-117 82-124 83-125 84-126 92-100 100-154 102-150 105-104 107-156 108-157 110-109 113-163 114-166 116-162 117-171 123-173 126-127 127-184 130-185 131-186 132-188 133-189 134-190 135-192 136-122 139-201 142-209 144-211 145-152 146-210 147-215 148-148 149-151 153-221 154-222 157-225 158-233 160-227 162-102 163-228 164-138 166-238 167-239 168-243 170-175 171-246 173-249 174-250 175-248 176-251
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You were standing in the doorway. I didn't know how long you had been there, maybe even saw me laughing in my dream. And the sadness that awakened with me, that moment of weakness. Cheng Gong, you softly called out my name, your voice was very hoarse as if it had been a long time since you had spoken. It was about to snow; the sky was getting really gloomy and the room was pitch black. The water on the stove was boiling and bubbling angrily. I looked at you carefully for a while and confirmed that I didn't know who you were. But in the dim light, suddenly I felt that this stranger standing across from me seemed deeply connected to my life. That feeling sent shivers down my spine. I tried hard to remember; memories flickered like cards flipping through in my mind.
