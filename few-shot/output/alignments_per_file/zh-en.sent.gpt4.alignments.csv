1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important event for me was my father's return, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to the school looking for me. I ran all the way to the front gate, and through the iron bars I could see him standing outside, smoking a cigarette. I was wearing a long black overcoat, the upturned collar covering half of my face. I don't know why, but without even getting a clear look at him, I got the impression that he was not doing well. My heart ached and tears started falling from my eyes.",3-4 5-1 6-2 7-5 10-8 11-9 14-14 15-17 17-18 18-19 19-23 20-24 21-27 22-22 24-21 25-28 26-32 28-29 29-30 30-33 31-34 32-36 33-38 35-40 36-41 37-42 38-43 40-44 42-48 44-51 45-52 47-49 48-57 53-62 54-63 55-64 56-65 57-67 58-69 59-70 61-73 63-76 64-75 66-79 67-80 73-87 74-88 75-89 77-92 78-93 79-98 80-99 82-103 83-109 85-102 86-107 87-106 90-115 91-116 96-118 97-121 98-122 99-123 100-124 102-110 103-128 104-130 106-135
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like I did. Besides, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness. Perhaps things were as they seemed, but happiness could still find her. Isn't that right? As a beautiful woman, she doesn't have to work so hard; she doesn't need to do anything at all. Simply standing still would be enough.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-7 7-9 10-10 11-11 12-12 13-13 14-14 15-15 16-16 17-18 18-20 19-21 20-25 21-28 22-30 23-33 25-22 26-24 28-34 29-36 30-37 32-39 34-41 35-42 36-44 37-46 38-47 40-52 42-50 45-55 48-61 49-62 50-63 53-66 54-67 55-54 56-72 59-76 60-79 61-80 64-88 65-89 67-91 68-98 69-94 70-95 71-97 73-102 74-104 78-109
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that year the winter was extraordinarily long, halfway into April and the winter jasmine had yet to bloom. The divorce of your parents has made you very depressed. We haven't had any new games for a long time, so we just sit aimlessly on the rooftop of the death tower every evening. Among the body parts scattered around the courtyard, a few more arms had been added. We used hooks to gather them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin statue.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 6-7 7-9 8-11 9-12 10-16 13-13 14-17 17-22 18-24 19-26 21-33 22-30 25-35 26-32 28-37 29-38 30-27 31-28 32-42 35-47 36-48 37-49 39-54 42-73 43-57 48-62 49-58 50-69 55-66 56-63 57-74 58-86 59-87 60-83 63-77 65-78 67-79 69-88 71-91 72-90 75-92 76-96 77-97 78-98 79-99 80-100 82-104 83-107 84-84 85-105 88-110 89-111 93-120 94-121
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father, in truth, had no clue about how to do business; he just went and sought refuge with a cousin who was practically a stranger.

5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You just said that everyone has a time to embark on their journey, as if life suddenly put a bridle on. I must have been eight years old. That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. From that moment on, I no longer had a home.",2-2 3-4 4-5 5-9 7-7 8-15 9-18 11-19 12-20 15-23 16-25 18-27 20-30 21-31 22-33 23-34 26-37 27-38 28-39 29-40 32-47 33-44 34-46 35-48 36-49 37-50 39-53 40-54 41-56 42-57 43-59 45-60
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I do not intend to keep the appointment. Regardless of the reason, I don't think it's necessary for us to meet again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. The sky was getting darker and suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Deliver The boy of water stood at the door with a bucket, saying he was delivering water to a house in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty, gray woolen hat, seemingly in a daze.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 6-9 7-13 9-14 11-25 13-28 14-27 18-29 19-30 20-31 22-34 23-32 27-36 28-38 30-43 32-45 35-57 36-49 43-41 47-62 51-72 52-65 55-73 56-74 57-80 58-85 62-82 63-77 64-79 66-88 67-89 68-90 70-70 72-93 76-96 77-98 78-94 79-101 80-102 85-110
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Each time I fell into silence, I felt a pressure on my heart and just wanted to end this meeting as soon as possible. You seem to have noticed something but you are still trying to find a topic to talk about. The tea cooled and the white fog in the house had cleared up, then finally you stood up to take your leave. Just as I closed the door and heaved a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again. You stood at the door, asking me to come to the Little White House later. Before I had a chance to refuse, you had already exited the building.",1-0 2-1 4-3 5-4 6-5 7-6 8-9 9-11 10-12 12-14 13-19 15-16 18-22 19-28 21-24 22-25 23-26 24-31 25-32 26-33 29-36 31-38 32-41 33-42 34-44 35-46 37-52 38-53 44-57 45-58 50-69 51-68 59-80 60-60 61-82 62-91 64-63 68-66 69-93 70-94 71-96 72-95 74-97 76-99 79-103 80-104 81-105 82-113 84-108 85-110 86-111 87-112 89-114 90-79 95-121 97-122 98-98 99-125 100-126 102-129 104-130
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家"" 你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half of the water had evaporated from the pot, filling the entire room with a mist. You sat downuneasily, watching me pour tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"" You ask.

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath you exhale, your windswept curly hair, the slight trembling of your knees beneath the hem of your coat - these all make me believe that you exist here and now; that you're not just some continuation of my previous dream. It's not surprising that you might not recognize me after eighteen years. You didn't wear makeup, your pale face was slightly puffy, but you didn't disappoint everyone's expectations and grew up to be a beauty. But her small, heart-shaped face was ashen, with an air of having lived in the big city for a long time. You ask me, are you different from what I imagined? I just smiled, neither agreeing nor disagreeing. To be honest, I have never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. As for me, everything related to you has already been put into a file bag and sealed with wax. It might hurt to say this, but I really don't expect to see you again.",3-4 5-1 7-2 8-6 14-12 15-13 16-14 17-15 22-26 24-19 25-20 26-21 28-33 29-34 30-35 31-38 32-39 37-42 39-51 41-58 43-59 44-101 45-54 46-60 47-73 48-75 57-65 59-77 60-80 61-81 62-82 63-83 66-86 68-88 70-89 71-91 72-92 78-99 79-102 80-103 81-104 83-109 84-110 85-111 86-112 91-114 96-90 97-124 100-134 102-137 107-140 108-141 109-143 111-120 113-147 114-150 116-146 123-155 127-168 131-170 132-172 133-173 134-174 135-193 139-185 142-189 144-191 146-190 147-195 148-197 149-198 150-200 151-201 153-203 154-204 156-206 157-207 158-212 160-209 166-214 167-215 168-169 171-221 172-180 173-224 174-225 175-223 176-226
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You're standing at the door. I don't know how long you have been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my dreams. There's also the sorrow that comes with waking up, at its most vulnerable. Cheng Gong, you called out my name in a low voice. Your voice was extremely hoarse, as if you hadn't spoken for a long time. Snow was about to fall, the sky was grim and overcast, inside the house it was pitch black. The water in the kettle was boiling, bubbling and rolling. I looked at you closely for a while, certain that I didn't recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite me seemed to have a deep connection with my life. That feeling gave me chills down my spine. I tried to remember, the memory cards in my mind flicking over one by one.
