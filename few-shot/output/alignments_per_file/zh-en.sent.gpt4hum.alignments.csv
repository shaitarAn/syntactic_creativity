1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"The most important thing that happened to me the winter of 1993 was that my father returned, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to the school to see me. I ran all the way to the front gate, and from afar through the iron railing, I could see him standing outside smoking. Wearing a long black trench coat, the turned-up collar masking half of his face. I don't know why, but even though I didn't get a clear look at him, I felt like he was having a hard time. My heart ached, and tears welled up in my eyes.",6-9 10-2 11-3 14-15 15-16 17-17 18-18 19-22 20-23 21-26 22-21 24-20 25-27 27-31 28-28 29-29 30-32 31-33 32-35 33-37 35-39 36-40 37-41 38-42 40-43 42-47 44-50 45-51 47-48 48-58 51-54 53-64 54-65 55-66 56-67 57-68 61-71 62-72 63-74 64-73 67-79 72-78 73-86 74-87 75-88 77-91 78-92 79-97 80-98 81-99 83-112 85-106 86-110 87-109 90-115 91-117 96-121 97-123 98-124 99-125 100-126 101-127 102-128 103-131 105-107 106-138
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I think she lacks the ability to find happiness. Perhaps this is the case, but happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't that so? As a beauty, she doesn't need to work that hard. She doesn't need to do anything, just stand in place would be enough.",0-0 1-1 2-2 3-4 4-5 5-6 6-8 7-11 11-12 12-13 13-14 14-15 15-16 16-17 17-19 18-21 19-22 20-26 21-29 22-31 23-34 25-23 26-25 28-35 29-37 30-38 32-39 34-41 35-42 36-44 37-45 38-47 40-51 42-49 43-53 45-54 47-74 48-59 49-60 50-61 51-62 52-64 53-66 54-67 56-72 59-76 60-78 61-79 64-87 65-88 67-80 68-97 70-94 71-96 72-98 73-99 74-100 75-102 78-106
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, the winter of that year was particularly long, half way through April and the spring blossoms had yet to bloom. The divorce of your parents has left you feeling very depressed. We haven't had any new games in a while, and when the evening comes we would just aimlessly sit on the roof of the tower of the dead. Among the body parts scattered around the yard, there were now a few more arms. We used hooks to pull them together, forming a thousand-hand Guanyin.",0-0 1-2 2-3 3-7 4-8 6-5 7-10 8-11 9-12 10-16 13-13 14-17 17-23 18-25 19-27 21-34 22-31 25-36 26-33 28-39 29-40 30-28 31-29 32-44 35-49 36-50 37-51 39-55 40-57 42-59 48-67 49-68 53-73 55-71 56-69 57-79 58-91 60-88 61-87 63-82 65-83 67-84 71-98 72-97 75-99 76-100 77-101 78-102 79-103 80-104 82-107 83-106 85-108 86-109 88-111 89-112 90-113 91-115 94-118
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"Actually, my father had no clue about doing business; he just went to join a distant cousin with whom he was not very familiar.

5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now you said that everyone has a time when their luck begins, as if life suddenly has reins on it. I think it was when I was eight. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.

6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I have no intention of keeping the appointment. Regardless of the reason, I don't think it's necessary for us to meet again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. As the sky gradually darkened, a sudden knock resounded at the door. Send The boy carrying water buckets stood at the doorway, saying he was off to deliver water to a family in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty, gray woolen hat, with a vacant look on his face.",0-0 1-2 2-3 4-7 5-8 6-9 7-13 9-14 11-25 13-28 14-27 18-29 19-30 20-31 22-34 23-32 27-36 28-38 30-44 34-50 35-59 36-45 39-46 43-41 47-63 48-64 49-65 50-66 51-69 52-70 55-75 56-76 57-83 58-88 60-84 62-85 63-81 64-82 66-91 67-92 70-95 72-96 75-72 76-99 77-101 78-97 79-104 80-105 81-110 85-114
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Every time I fell silent, I felt a pressure on my heart, and all I wanted was to end the meeting quickly. You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying hard to find a topic. The tea cooled off, the white mist in the room had completely dissipated, and you finally rose to take your leave. I had just closed the door and let out a sigh of relief when the doorbell rang again. You stood at the doorway, asking me to come to the small white building later.

8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家"" 你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half of the water had evaporated from the kettle, and the whole room was shrouded in white mist. You sit down uncomfortably, watching me pour tea.

9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath you exhale, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, the slight tremble of your knees under your coat hem— all these convince me that your presence is real and not just a continuation of a previous dream. It's been eighteen years, so it wouldn't be strange if you didn't recognize me. You're not wearing any makeup, your pale face is a little swollen, but at least you did not disappoint everyone's expectations, you have grown into a beauty. Only, her small peach-heart shaped face was dark and gloomy, she had the demeanor of having been in the big city for a long time. You ask me if you look different from what I imagined. I gave a noncommittal smile. To be honest, I've never imagined what you would look like grown up. As far as I'm concerned, everything about you has been put into a file and sealed with wax. It might hurt to say this, but honestly, I did not look forward to seeing you again.",3-4 4-12 5-1 7-2 8-6 12-13 14-11 16-10 17-17 22-28 23-20 25-22 27-25 28-27 30-35 31-37 32-38 36-42 37-40 38-43 39-44 40-41 41-51 43-52 44-104 45-48 46-53 47-58 48-60 52-61 53-74 57-68 58-76 59-77 60-80 61-81 62-83 63-84 65-9 66-87 67-89 68-90 70-92 71-93 72-94 76-100 78-102 79-105 82-111 83-112 84-113 86-115 91-118 100-145 102-148 107-151 108-152 110-107 113-158 114-161 116-157 125-171 126-172 127-175 129-224 130-176 131-177 132-180 133-181 134-182 135-184 136-109 139-191 142-199 144-201 145-143 146-200 147-203 148-205 149-206 150-208 153-210 154-212 156-213 157-214 158-219 160-216 163-217 166-221 167-222 168-225 170-228 171-230 173-233 174-234 175-232 176-235
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I open my eyes. You are standing at the doorway. I have no idea how long you've been standing there. You might have even seen me laughing in my dream. There's the sorrow of waking up, in its most vulnerable state. Cheng Gong, you whispered my name in a very hoarse voice, as if you haven't spoken for a long time. It's about to snow, the sky is heavily overcast, and the house is pitch dark. The water on the stove was boiling, gurgling and rolling. I looked at you carefully for a moment, certain that I did not recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite me seemed to have a deep connection with my life. That kind of feeling sends chills down one's spine. I tried hard to recall, the cards of memory flipping through my mind.
