1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing that happened to me was that my father returned home, just before my mother got remarried. One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me. I ran towards the school gate, and saw him standing outside, smoking a cigarette. He was wearing a black long-sleeved shirt, and his collar was pulled up to cover half of his face. I don't know why, but even his appearance seemed strange to me. My heart ached, and tears streamed down my face."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought my mother would remarry. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. And indeed, happiness may have found her, but as a beautiful woman, she didn't need to work hard for it. She could just stand in one place and everything would be fine."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember that winter was especially long that year, and it was already halfway through April, but the spring flowers hadn't bloomed yet. The news of my parents' divorce had you feeling down. We hadn't had any new games in a long time, and every evening, we'd sit on the rooftop of the death tower, feeling listless. In the courtyard, there were more and more broken body parts, and we used hooks to gather them together, creating a scene of a thousand-handed Guanyin."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father actually didn't have much experience with business, he just went to work for a distant relative who wasn't very familiar to him. My mother had a younger sister who went to Beijing early on and later got married and had children there. This cousin is the eldest son in their family and has always been seen as an outsider within the family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"""You just said that everyone has a time when their luck changes, and life seems to suddenly take off. Mine was when I was eight years old. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. From then on, I never had a home again."""
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I don't plan on leaving. No matter the reason, I think it's unnecessary for us to meet again. I sit on the sofa, taking puffs of smoke, and the sky gradually darkens. Suddenly, the doorbell rings loudly. The water delivery boy stands at the door, holding a water tank, and says he's there to deliver water to a household in the west. He wears a worn-out gray woolen hat, looking quite embarrassed."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was going on with great difficulty. Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being pressed, and I just wanted to quickly end this meeting. You seemed to notice, but you were still trying to find topics to talk about. The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the house had already dissipated. You finally got up to leave, and I had just closed the door, feeling a sense of relief. The doorbell rang again, and you stood at the door, asking me to come to the small white building later. I hadn't even had the chance to decline, and you had already left the building."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. The water had already boiled half a pot, and the entire room was filled with white mist. You sat down impatiently, looking at me as I poured tea. ""Do you still live with your grandma and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that my grandma had passed away, and now I lived with my aunt. ""She never got married"" you asked. ""Yes."""
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"""The white breath that comes out of your mouth, the wind-blown hair, the slightly trembling knees under the skirt, these make me believe that you in front of me are real, not a continuation of that dream. Eighteen years have passed, and it's not strange that I don't recognize you. You haven't put on makeup, your pale face has a hint of puffiness, but overall, you've exceeded everyone's expectations and grown into a beauty. However, that small, delicate face with a hint of sadness in your eyes, it's as if you've been waiting for a long time in the big city, and your expression is a little worn out. You ask me, does your appearance now differ from how I imagined it? I can't help but smile. To be honest, I've never imagined what you'd look like after growing up. For me, everything related to you has already been packed away in an archive, sealed with a layer of dust. Saying it out loud might be a bit hurtful, but I really haven't been expecting to see you again."""
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I open my eyes. You're standing at the door. I don't know how long you've been standing there, but I didn't even notice you in my dreams. There's also a deep sadness, like a fragile and weak moment. Zhang, you call out my name in a low voice, and the sound seems to have been silent for a long time. It's about to snow, and the sky is dark and gloomy. The house is pitch black, and the water on the stove is boiling. I carefully look at you and confirm that I don't recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly feel a deep connection between this stranger standing opposite me and my own life. That feeling makes my back feel cold. I try to recall, and the memory cards in my brain flip through quickly. Then you say, ""I am Li Jiaju."""
