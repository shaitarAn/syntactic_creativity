1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing that happened to me was that my father returned, just a week before my mother's wedding."
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"On a December afternoon, he came to the school to find me."
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。,"I flew towards the entrance, saw him standing outside while smoking, and watched him from afar through the iron bars."
4,身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"""I'm wearing a black long-sleeved shirt with a stand-up collar that covers half of my face."""
5,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"""I don't know why, but I couldn't see his face clearly, and I felt like he was not doing well."""
6,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"My heart aches, and tears stream down my face."
7,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I never thought my mother would remarry.
8,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should be sad and hurt because of my father's departure, just like me."
9,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。,"""Moreover, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness."""
10,事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"""The facts may be true, but happiness has the power to find her."""
11,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"""Isn't that right? As a beauty, she doesn't need to work hard at all. She can just stand in one place and that's it."""
12,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"I still remember that winter was especially long that year. By the time April had passed halfway, the spring flowers had yet to bloom."
13,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,"""The news of your parents' divorce is really depressing."""
14,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We haven't had any new games for a long time, and every evening we'd sit on the rooftop of the building where the dead bodies were piled up, feeling listless."
15,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,"""There were more limbs scattered in the courtyard, including several pairs of arms."""
16,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,We used a rake to gather them together and created a scene of a thousand-handed Guanyin.
17,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,"My father actually didn't understand much about business, he just went to visit a distant cousin he wasn't familiar with."
18,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,"My grandmother had a younger sister who went to Beijing in her early years, got married, and had children there."
19,这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,This guy is the eldest son of her family and has always been treated as an outcast within the family.
20,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"""You just said that every person has a time when they're on a roll, and life feels like it's suddenly been put on hold."""
21,我的应该是在八岁。,"""I should be eight years old."""
22,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,"That autumn, Father left Jinan and went to Beijing by himself."
23,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"From then on, I never had a home again."
24,我并不打算赴约。,"""I didn't plan to go to the appointment."""
25,不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,"""No matter what the reason, I think it's unnecessary for us to meet again."""
26,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。,"I sat on the sofa, puffing on my cigarette, and the sky gradually darkened. Suddenly, the door knocked loudly."
27,送,"""Hello... Are you there?... Is anyone going to come listen to me ramble? Let me begin by telling you about myself. Caterpillars were hanging in midair—desiccated and reduced to powder. In early autumn, Uncle Yan, in order to write down the story of what happened to our town that night, once again moved out of his home and into a three-room house he had rented next to a reservoir to the south of town. During that period, I would go every other day to walk around the ruins surrounding the crematorium, to look for Little Juanzi, who had disappeared. Send."""
28,水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,The boy carrying the water bucket stands at the door and says he's delivering water to a household in the west end.
29,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,He wore a dirty gray woolen cap with a confused expression.
30,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,Our conversation was very difficult.
31,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time I fell into silence, I felt pressured in my heart, and I just wanted to quickly end this meeting."
32,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic to talk about."
33,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"""The tea has been drunk, the white mist in the house has dispersed, and you have finally stood up to say goodbye."""
34,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,"""I had just closed the door and felt a sense of relief when the doorbell rang again."""
35,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。,You stand at the door and ask me to come to Xiaobai Tower later.
36,我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,You've already left the building before I could even react.
37,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.
38,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"The water had evaporated half a bowl, and the entire room was shrouded in white mist."
39,你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。,You sit down and watch me pour tea.
40,"""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""","""Are you still living with your grandmother and aunts?"""
41,你问。,你问。
42,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"""I'm telling you, Grandma has passed away, and now I'm living with my aunt."""
43,"""她一直没成家""　你问。","""She never got married"" you asked."
44,"""嗯。""","""Ah, okay. Let me begin by telling you about myself. Caterpillars were hanging in midair—desiccated and reduced to powder. In early autumn, Uncle Yan, in order to write down the story of what happened to our town that night, once again moved out of his home and into a three-room house he had rented next to a reservoir to the south of town. During that period, I would go every other day to walk around the ruins surrounding the crematorium, to look for Little Juanzi, who had disappeared. 'Ah, okay.'"""
45,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"Your breath whitewashed the haze,"
46,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,"""I haven't seen her for 18 years, and it's not surprising that I can't recognize her."""
47,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。,"You haven't put on makeup, your pale face has a hint of puffiness, but overall, you've exceeded everyone's expectations and have become a beauty."
48,只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"""She had a delicate and melancholic face, with a hint of sadness that seemed to have been left behind by the hustle and bustle of the big city."""
49,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,"You ask me, your appearance is not the same as I imagined."
50,我不置可否地笑了笑。,"""I couldn't help but smile."""
51,坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,"""Frankly speaking, I've never imagined what you'd look like after growing up."""
52,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"""Everything related to you has been put away in a file and sealed with wax."""
53,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"""I'll just say it straight out, maybe it'll hurt someone's feelings, but I didn't really expect to see you again."""
54,我睁开眼睛。,I open my eyes.
55,你站在门囗。,You're standing at the door.
56,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。,"""I don't know how long you've been standing there, but I even saw you laughing in my dreams."""
57,还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,There are also the sad and weakest moments when you are sober.
58,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"""Cheng Gong, you call out my name in a low voice, the sound is very rusty, as if you haven't opened your mouth to speak in a long time."""
59,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,"""It's almost snowing, the sky is dark and gloomy, and the house is pitch black."""
60,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,"The water on the stove is boiling, making a ""gurgle, gurgle"" sound as it rolls."
61,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。,"""I carefully looked at you for a while, and I'm sure I don't recognize you."""
62,可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"But in the dim light, I suddenly felt a deep connection between my life and the life of the stranger standing opposite me."
63,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,That feeling gave me goosebumps.
64,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。,"""I tried my best to recall, and the memories were fluttering in my mind like a deck of cards."""
65,然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"Then you say, you are Li Jiaju."
