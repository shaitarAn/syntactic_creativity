1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。,"The most important thing for me that winter of 1993 was that my father came back, just one week before my mother got married."
2,十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。,"On a December afternoon, he came to the school to find me."
3,我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。,"I ran all the way to the front gate and saw him standing outside smoking, separated from me by iron bars."
4,身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。,"He was wearing a black trench coat, and the collar stood up, partially covering his face."
5,不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。,"I don't know why, but even though I couldn't see his face clearly, I felt that he was not doing well."
6,我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,My heart ached and tears rolled down my face.
7,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。,I never thought my mother would have the idea of getting remarried.
8,或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。,"Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me."
9,况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。,"Moreover, I feel like she lacks the ability to find happiness."
10,事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。,"Perhaps that is the case, but happiness has the ability to find her."
11,不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"Isn't that right? As a beauty, she didn't need to work hard at all. She didn't have to do anything, just stand in one place."
12,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。,"I still remember, that winter was particularly long. By mid-April, the winter jasmine still hadn't bloomed."
13,父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。,The divorce of your parents has greatly affected your mood.
14,我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。,"We haven't had any new games in a long time, so every evening we would sit lazily on the rooftop of the Pagoda of Eternal Rest."
15,院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。,"Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were several more arms."
16,我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"We used hooks to pull them together, forming a thousand-armed goddess of mercy."
17,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。,"Actually, my dad had no clue about doing business; he just went to seek refuge with a cousin whom he wasn't very close to."
18,我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。,My grandmother has a younger sister who went to Beijing in her early years and later got married and had children there.
19,这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,This cousin is the eldest son of her family and has always been seen as an outsider within the whole family.
20,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。,"Just now you said that everyone has a time of good fortune, and it seems as if life has suddenly been fitted with a bridle."
21,我的应该是在八岁。,I should be around eight years old.
22,那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。,"That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone."
23,从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Since then, I no longer had a home."
24,我并不打算赴约。,I have no intention of keeping the appointment.
25,不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。,"Regardless of the reason, I don't think it's necessary for us to meet again."
26,我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。,"I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another. The sky grew darker and the door suddenly knocked."
27,送,Send
28,水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。,"The water boy stood at the gate with a bucket, saying that he was going to deliver water to a family in the western suburbs."
29,他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,He wore a dirty gray woolen cap and had a vacant look on his face.
30,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。,Our conversation was very difficult.
31,每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。,"Every time I fell into silence, I felt my heart being oppressed, and I just wanted this meeting to end quickly."
32,你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。,"You seem to have sensed something, but you're still trying to find a topic."
33,茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。,"The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the room had dispersed. Finally, you stood up and bid your farewell."
34,我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。,"I had just closed the door and felt relieved, when the doorbell rang again."
35,你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。,You stand at the doorway and ask me to come to Xiaobailou later.
36,我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,I hadn't even had the chance to decline before you walked out of the building.
37,我走到厨房关掉炉子。,I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.
38,水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。,"Half of the water in the kettle had evaporated, and the whole room was filled with white mist."
39,你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。,You sat down nervously while I poured the tea.
40,"""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""","""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"""
41,你问。,You ask.
42,我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。,"I'll tell you, Grandma has passed away; now I live with my aunt."
43,"""她一直没成家""　你问。","""She never got married,"" you ask."
44,"""嗯。""","""Hmm."""
45,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。,"The white breath that escapes from your mouth, the curly hair swayed by the wind, the slightly trembling knees underneath your coat—these make me believe that you are a real presence in front of me, not just a continuation of my dream."
46,十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。,It's not surprising that I didn't recognize him after 18 years.
47,你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。,"You're not wearing makeup, and your pale face is a little swollen, but you haven't let everyone down; you've grown into a beauty."
48,只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。,"But her small peach-shaped face looked desolate, as if she had been in the city for a long time."
49,你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。,You ask me if your appearance is different from what I imagined.
50,我不置可否地笑了笑。,I smiled ambiguously.
51,坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。,"To be honest, I never imagined what you would look like when you grew up."
52,对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。,"As far as I'm concerned, everything related to you has been packed into a file and sealed with wax."
53,说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"It might hurt someone's feelings if I said it out loud, but I really don't expect to see you again."
54,我睁开眼睛。,I opened my eyes.
55,你站在门囗。,You are standing at the entrance.
56,我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。,I don't know how long you've been standing there. Maybe you even saw me laughing in my dream.
57,还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。,"There is the awakening of sorrow, the appearance of vulnerability at its weakest moment."
58,程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。,"Cheng Gong, you whispered my name in a very hoarse voice, as if you haven't spoken in a long time."
59,快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。,"It's going to snow soon, and the sky is very dark. The house is pitch black."
60,炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。,"The water on the stove is boiling, bubbling and rolling."
61,我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。,I looked at you carefully for a while and confirmed that I didn't know you.
62,可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。,"But in the dim light, I suddenly felt a deep connection between myself and this stranger standing across from me."
63,那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。,That kind of feeling sent chills down one's spine.
64,我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。,"I tried hard to recall, and the memory cards swirled and flipped in my mind."
65,然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"And then you said, ""You are Li Jiaqi."""
