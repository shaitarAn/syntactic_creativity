1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my father came back, just one week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to the school to find me. I ran all the way to the entrance and saw him standing outside smoking from a distance across the iron bars. He was wearing a black overcoat with its collar up covering half his face. I don't know why, but even though I couldn't see his face clearly, I felt like he wasn't doing well at all. My heart felt heavy, and tears rolled down my cheeks."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer from the pain of my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I believed she lacked the ability to find happiness. The truth may indeed have been so, but happiness has the power to find her as well. Isn't it true that being a beautiful woman should not be so hard? She didn't need to do anything; she just needed to stand in place."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember that winter was particularly long that year, halfway through April and the welcomewort flowers had not yet bloomed. Your mood was very low due to your parents' divorce. We hadn't come up with any new games for a long time and would sit listlessly on the rooftop of the Dead People's Tower as evening fell. Among the scattered body parts in the yard, there were several more arms. We used a hook to gather them together and arranged them into an image of Thousand-Armed Guanyin."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father actually had no clue about doing business; he just went to seek refuge with a distant cousin who wasn't even that familiar. My grandmother had a sister who had moved to Beijing early on and later married and had children there. This cousin was the eldest son of her family, and he had always been seen as somewhat of an outsider within the entire family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now you said that everyone has a moment when their destiny begins, as if life suddenly dons a harness. For me, that moment should have been at the age of eight. It was in the autumn of that year when my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. Since then, I haven't had a home anymore."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I have no intention of keeping the appointment. No matter what the reason may be, I don't think we need to see each other again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another as the sky grew darker. Suddenly, there was a sharp knock on the door. A boy delivering water stood at the entrance with a bucket, saying he was here to deliver water to a household in the western outskirts. He wore a dirty gray woolen hat and had a dazed expression on his face."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very difficult. Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being squeezed and just wanted the meeting to end quickly. It seemed like you noticed it too, but you were still trying to find topics to talk about. The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the room had dissipated. Finally, you got up to bid farewell. Just as I closed the door and felt a sense of relief, the doorbell rang again. You were standing at the doorway asking me to come to Xiaobailou later that evening. Before I could even refuse, you had already walked out of the building entrance."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a kettle of water had already evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist. You sat down awkwardly as I poured tea. ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt. ""She never got married,"" you inquired. ""No,"" I replied."
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath that comes out of your mouth, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, and the slightly trembling knees under the hem of your coat—all these convince me that you before me are a real existence, not just a continuation of my past dream. It's been eighteen years since we last met, so it's not surprising that I couldn't recognize you at first glance. You're not wearing makeup; your pale face looks a bit swollen, but at least you haven't disappointed everyone's expectations—you've grown into a beauty. However, that heart-shaped face still carries a somewhat forlorn look—like someone who has spent too long in a big city. You asked me if your appearance was different from what I had imagined. I smiled ambiguously in response. Truth be told, I have never envisioned what you would look like as an adult. Everything related to you has already been filed away and sealed with wax in my mind. Perhaps speaking about it might hurt someone, but truly, I never expected to see you again."
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes, and there you were at the door. I didn't know how long you had been standing there; maybe I even saw you in my dreams, laughing heartily. And waking up to sadness, feeling most vulnerable. Cheng Gong, you softly called out my name, your voice very hoarse as though it had been a long time since you last spoke. It was nearly snowing, with the sky darkening greatly and the room pitch black. The water on the stove was boiling, bubbling away noisily. I studied you carefully for a while and was certain that I didn’t recognize you. However, in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing across from me seemed to have a deep connection with my life. That sensation sent shivers down my spine. As I tried hard to remember, memories flashed through my mind like flipping cards. Then you said: You are Li Jiaqi."
