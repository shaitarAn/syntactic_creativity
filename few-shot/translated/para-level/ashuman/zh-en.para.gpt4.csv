1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"In the winter of 1993, the most significant event for me was my father's return, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to find me at school. I ran all the way to the front gate and through and saw him standing outside smoking from a distance. He wore a long black trench coat with his collar up that obscured half of his face. For some reason I couldn't make out his features clearly but had this feeling that he wasn’t doing well. My heart tightened, and tears welled up in my eyes."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would contemplate remarriage. Perhaps subconsciously, I believed that she should continue to grieve my father's departure, just as I was. Moreover, it seemed to me like she lacked the ability to find happiness. Perhaps this was indeed the case, but happiness has the ability to find her. Isn't it so? As a beautiful woman, things shouldn’t be so hard for her; she didn't need to do anything but simply stand in place."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember, that winter was particularly long. Halfway through April, the spring flowers had yet to bloom. The divorce of your parents had left you in a very gloomy mood. We hadn't had any new games for a long time, and by dusk we would sit idly on the roof of the Dead Man's Tower. Among the body parts scattered in the yard, there were a few more arms added and with hooks we gathered them together to form a Thousand-Armed Guanyin statue."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"Actually, my father didn't know anything about business; he only went to join a cousin he wasn't familiar with. My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing early on and later married and had children there. This cousin, her oldest son, has always been considered an outlier in our entire family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"Just now, you said that everyone has a moment when their destiny begins to take shape, like suddenly being harnessed by reins. Mine was probably when I was eight. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. After that, I never really had a home again."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I wasn’t planning to meet up. Regardless of the reasons, I believe there’s no need for us to see each other again. I’m sitting on the sofa, chain-smoking one cigarette after another. It’s getting darker outside when suddenly there's a knock at the door. A water delivery boy is standing at my doorway with his buckets, saying he's off to deliver water to a house in the Western suburbs. He's wearing a dirty gray woolen hat and seems rather listless."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was very strenuous. Every time we fell into silence, I felt oppressed and only wanted to end the meeting quickly. You seemed to have noticed, but continued trying to find topics of conversation. As the tea cooled down and the fog in the room dissipated, you finally got up and said goodbye. No sooner had I closed the door and exhaled a sigh of relief than the doorbell rang again. You were standing at my threshold asking me to come over your place, Small White Building, later in evening. Before I even had a chance to refuse your invite, you had already disappeared down into stairs."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？""你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家""　你问。 ""嗯。""","I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half of the water had already evaporated, and the entire room was shrouded in a white mist. You sat down uneasily, watching me pour tea. ""Do you still live with your grandma and aunt?"" you asked. I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt. ""She's never married,"" you stated more than asked. ""Yes."""
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The faint mist you exhale, your hair tossed about by the wind, the slight trembling of your knees beneath your coat hem—these details convince me that you're not an extension of my previous dream but a real being standing before me. It has been eighteen years; it's no surprise if I can't recognize you. You haven’t put on makeup; your pale face is slightly puffy, but true to everyone's expectations, has matured into a beauty’s face. But that peach-like little face of yours seems sullen and shows signs of having lived in the big city for too long. You asked me whether you look different than what I had imagined. I smiled ambiguously without giving a clear yes or no response. Frankly speaking, I have never imagined what you would look like when grown up. To me, everything about you has already been packed into an archive bag and sealed off with wax - unpleasant as it may sound for others to hear this truth - but truly, I have never anticipated meeting with you again."
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I open my eyes. You're standing by the door. I don't know how long you've been standing there, perhaps you even saw me laughing in my sleep, and also my sadness upon waking up, at my most vulnerable moment. ""Cheng Gong,"" you whisper my name in a voice so hoarse it sounds like you haven't spoken for a long time. It's about to snow and the sky is heavily overcast, cloaking the room in darkness. The water on the stove starts to boil and gurgles loudly. I scrutinize your face carefully and am positive that I don’t recognize you; however, in this dim light it suddenly seems to me that this stranger before me has a deep connection with my own life—such a realization sends chills down one’s spine. As I struggle to remember something from our possible past, memory cards flip through my mind quickly one after another until finally . . . then you say: “I’m Li Jiaqi.”"
