But it very rarely peered through the fog as a blurred white spot, providing neither heat nor shade.
"No," the grandfather replied.
Then one of them would start to shiver, making light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim aside.
It laid on its side panting and flapping fins.
Later on, when we remembered the incident in Sturdzovsky Lane, Yasha claimed that whenever you want to do something in an ideal way you're bound to mess up over trivial matters.
The night was late and silent, not a single star above our heads.
The river was roaring.
Then from far out at sea there flickered a dim fire and faded out immediately afterwards.
He reached the Tsar's capital and found out that she had died perhaps she couldn't stand the separation.
Then she dropped to her knees and fell headlong into the sand.
Light streaks ran endlessly across the ceiling, lightweight waves reflections of the river.
Water rippled moving lily pads; whirligig beetles hastily scattered away and finally golden gleams started flickering in mysterious depths.
If there are people in the archway, they might not notice us at all.
Only occasionally would a solitary ray cut diagonally across the thicket and reveal to us the stunning strength of plant life.
I went to the riverside with my Uncle Ilko.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, revealing many qualities in them that we had not previously noticed.
From there she watched as they carried out father.
The sun couldn't break through the dense greenery of this forest.
Yasha was counting seconds to himself.
At night on the other side of the river, someone started waving a lantern and shouting loudly.
I was filling a bucket with water from the pond, adding grass to the water and waiting.
And all this time someone kept waving a lantern on that far bank and shouting, but their words couldn't be made out over the noise of the river.
Underneath the single old plane tree with lemon spots on its trunk lay leaves that seemed to be cut out of dull green velvet.
On the contrary, if we walk on the side opposite to the archway, they could spot us from afar.
My calculations seemed mathematically accurate to me.
Until my father dragged onto flattened grass a heavy crucian carp it was impossible to distinguish what it was.
Red bobbers stood motionlessly in the water.
As we were walking by an alleyway, Yasha stumbled.
We knew that from Sturdzovsky Lane to the Landesman sanatorium it was a seven-minute walk.
We stealthily went down the alley.
I watched, motionless, as it irritably backed away and came out of the narrow flower.
She stood motionless on the bank.
It rolled in with long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subduing.
Ants paraded in a line through the cast-iron gate carrying supplies to their underground larders for winter while under an anchor chain lived a small timid frog.
The relentless noise of the sea didn't cease for a minute.
I knew this by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely audible tremor of a solitary sycamore leaf.
He decided then to go to Petersburg in order to see that woman before he became totally blind.
On that bank, Countess Branicka's nature reserve forest was rising up the slope.
The wild freshness of the flooded waters, of thawed earth blew in our faces.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses unharnessed and tethered to it, and a little woman in black mother.
The river roared right there, nearby.
In the pitted yellow stone, there were many small seashells firmly embedded within it, on the ragweed bushes a few flowers still remained, sitting on straight firm stems like soaked and shriveled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
I woke up in the morning from the hot sun beating against the white walls.
I had noticed this stubborn gray leaf during daytime but now at night it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only wakeful friend.
Water rushed over the dam in a cold waterfall.
Its scales had an amazing scent similar to that of an underwater kingdom.
Ostap began to go blind.
"That's true, we didn't meet.
But it wasn't going away; it was here.
