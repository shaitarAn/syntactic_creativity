I'd never imagined Mom would want to marry again.
I told you Granny was dead, but yes, I was still with Auntie.
There were now more dismembered arms among the body parts in the courtyard.

This cousin of Dad's was her eldest son, and he didn't fit into our clan at all.
One afternoon in December, he showed up at my school and asked for me.
We reached for them with a grappling hook, pulling them into the shape of a thousand-handed Goddess of Mercy.
