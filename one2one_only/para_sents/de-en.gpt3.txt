When I was younger, I would always hold her wrist, place my thumb on her pulse and imagine that the entire world did everything in the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat.
She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it in half, and put it in my sandwich box.
Selma was still standing tall in front of the kitchen bench.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops in between.
This morning, only a few hours after Selma's dream, the people in the village moved as if lightning had frozen on all paths, not only outside but also in the houses, lightning in the kitchens and living rooms.
All day long they suspected their own lives and, as far as possible, that of others.
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and fir trees.
They looked up to exclude falling roof tiles, branches or heavy lampshades.
In first class, I had listed off to Martin what I saw during the ride, and Martin tried to memorize it all.
"Do you know exactly when you dreamed this?"
She looked at the dog for a long time.
"But," I said, "it could also have been a deformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the rust-red color, you couldn't really make out all that in the night, everything was so blurry."
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she was still floundering, she nudged the cheese off the counter with her wrist.
Then she looked at my father as if he was a gift shop.
That's how our minds work.
That always reliably put me to sleep, but now, at ten years old, Selma thought I was too old for it.
They moved as if their own bodies were completely foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable.
I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the grocer stocking juice bags, my mother stacking pine branches, my father stamping prescriptions, and all of them doing it exactly in Selma's heart rhythm.
That was true.
"Of course," Bauer Häubel would say, "please come in," and death would enter.
On such days, anything was possible, it was not much more absurd than an okapi for an old dachshund to bite through one's throat.
"Around three o'clock," Selma said.
Three o'clock.
He imagined death knocking carefully, opening the door only a crack and asking, "May I?" which Bauer Häubel would naturally answer in the affirmative.
In the blink of an eye, they can make the most disparate things belong together.
They were not scared when the screech owl called at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled with its head down at night.
"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously," Selma said, but she said it like a TV detective who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously.
Selma now stood still and looked down at the cheese package as if it were something precious that had broken into a thousand pieces.
Again and again they looked back to check if someone would jump at them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing more to lose, and they quickly looked forward again because someone without a mind could also attack head-on.
Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, most people in the village were not superstitious.
He was sure that death would not snatch his life away, but take it gently from his hand.
That worked very well, so that in the second year of school I no longer listed anything and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything I saw through the fogged-up train window: "Wire factory," he said, just as we passed the wire factory.
"What would you like on your school sandwich today?" she trilled again.
Bauer Häubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as he himself had been his whole life.
He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which Bauer Häubel knew would not bother him at all, and then place a hand on Bauer Häubel's eyes.
"Mäuselchen," she trilled once more, and the trilling and Mäuselchen were really alarming.
The people in the village were uneasy; it was visible, even though most of them tried to show nothing.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear's claws, and we all knew what that meant.
He was completely right, and unfortunately he had said more than he should have answered to the voices.
"That was cowardice," the optician said, shifting the leather bag to his other hip, because the jostling of the bag and the jostling of the voices was beginning to hurt.
When I slept downstairs with Selma, she would tell me bedtime stories with happy endings.
