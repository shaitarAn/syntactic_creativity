When I was younger, I would always hold her hand and place my thumb on her pulse, imagining that the whole world was beating in time with Selma's heart.
She placed a slice of cheese on the bread, closed it, and put it in my butter bread box.
Selma was still standing upright in front of the kitchen counter.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops along the way.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved about as if lightning had formed on every path, not just outside, but also inside the houses, lightning in the kitchens and living rooms.
All day long, they begrudged their own lives and, as much as possible, those of others.
For example, coffee pots and shoelaces, or deposit bottles and fir trees.
They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles branches or heavy lampshades.
In first class, I listed everything I saw during the ride, and Martin tried to memorize it.
"Do you know when you dreamed that exactly?"
She looked long at the dog.
"Well," I said, it could have been a deformed cow, a misassembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and rusty color, one couldn't exactly distinguish that in the dark, everything was pretty blurry.
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she was still fidgeting, she accidentally knocked the cheese off the cutting board with her wrist.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop.
Our mind works that way.
That's how I always fell asleep, but now that I'm ten, Selma says I'm too old for that.
They moved as if their own bodies were foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed, and even the objects they handled were highly flammable.
I pictured the optician polishing lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth pruning her hedge, the grocer stacking juice boxes, my mother layering fir branches, my father stamping recipes, and everyone doing it all in perfect rhythm with Selma's heartbeat.
That was correct.
Farmer Häubel would naturally answer, "Of course," and death would enter.
On days like these anything was possible; even a mangy mutt could bite through one's throat much more likely than an okapi.
"At three o'clock," said Selma.
And then at her alarm clock: Three o'clock.
He pictured death knocking softly, opening the door only a crack, and asking, "May I come in?"
It can quickly make the most unrelated things belong together.
They weren't scared when the screech owl called at night when a horse in the stable was heavily sweating, when a dog whined at night with his head lowered.
"We should probably not take this too seriously," said Selma—but she spoke with the gravity of a TV detective dismissing an anonymous tip-off as not worthy of concern.
Selma stopped and looked down at the cheese package as if it were something precious that had just broken into a thousand pieces.
They kept looking behind them to check if someone was creeping up with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked away again because such a person could attack them head-on.
Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the villagers were mostly not superstitious.
He was sure that death wouldn't snatch life away from him, but rather take it gently from his hand.
He did very well, so in the second year, I didn't need to list anything anymore, and Martin, with his back to the window and eyes closed, could almost perfectly recite everything I saw through the dirty train window: "Wire factory," he said, exactly at the moment we passed the wire factory.
"What can we have on our sandwiches today?" she asked, her voice still squeaky.
Farmer Häubel was convinced that death would be polite, just like he had been throughout his life.
He would apologize for the coldness of his hands, which wouldn't bother Farmer Häubel at all, and then place a hand on Farmer Häubel's eyes.
"Mousie," she added, and the squeaking and mouse-like sounds were really starting to get on my nerves.
The villagers were uneasy, it was plain to see, even though they mostly tried to hide it.
His body was still small, but his paws were huge like bear paws, and we all knew what that meant.
He was right, and he had unfortunately said more than he should have.
"Cowardice was it," the optician said, shifting his leather bag to the other hip because the rustling of the bag and the rustling of the voices were starting to hurt.
When I slept below Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at bedtime.
