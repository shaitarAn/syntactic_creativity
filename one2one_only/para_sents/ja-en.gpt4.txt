When my sister was scolded by our mother for something ordinary and different from what I would do, I would approach our mother and ask her why she was angry.
I wonder if those small habits and gestures that the two had when we last met have already drifted away somewhere.
The convenience store is filled with sound.
I try to recall if this has always been the case, but my memory is vague.
"Should I get more?"
I swiftly move around inside the store and slide into behind the counter to avoid keeping customers waiting.
"Welcome, good morning!"
Quickly put canned coffee, cigarettes, and an American dog into a small-sized bag.
With a slight bow, I take the can of coffee handed over by the male customer.
Although I could ask 'Would you like anything else?', whenever it seems that he's doubting whether to purchase or not, I choose to step back and wait patiently.
From this gesture, I quickly deduced that he intended to pay with electronic money.
At that moment, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time.
Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family home in her hometown, where friends often gather.
Sure enough, there was a man approaching the register with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand still shoved in his pocket.
Me, a proper part of this world, was truly born on this day.
Reacting to the faint sound of coins, known as "chali", I turn and look toward the cash register.
Miho and Satsuki, perhaps due to their frequent encounters locally, share the same facial expressions and way of speaking.
People who jingle coins in their palms or pockets are often those who are about to quickly buy cigarettes or a newspaper, so I'm sensitive to the sound of money.
Once the lecture ended because of my question to our mother, my sister always said "thank you" to meâ€”perhaps because she felt like I protected her.
Meanwhile, the man jingling change in his pocket suddenly reached into his chest pocket.
Particularly, their way of eating sweets is similar; they both break cookies into small pieces with their nailed hands and bring them to their mouths.
For the two weeks leading up to the opening, we kept practicing relentlessly, pairing up and dealing with fellow employees as if they were imaginary customers.
"Could you please touch for age verification?"
Smiling and bowing while looking into our "customers'" eyes, placing feminine products in paper bags, separating warm items from cold ones when packing them, or disinfecting our hands with alcohol when handling fast food orders.
