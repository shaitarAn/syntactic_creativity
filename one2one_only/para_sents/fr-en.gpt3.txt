Photos, browned and stained on the back by the fingers of all those who had held them at other meals, passed from hand to hand.
Under the immutability, the posters of the circus of last year with the photo of Roger Lanzac, the first communion images distributed to the comrades, the Club of Songwriters on Radio Luxembourg, the days were filled with new desires.

Another photograph, signed by the same photographer but the paper of the booklet is more ordinary and the gilt edging has disappeared no doubt destined for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of about four years old, serious, almost sad despite a good round face under short hair, parted in the middle and pulled back with barrettes to which ribbons are attached, like butterflies.
