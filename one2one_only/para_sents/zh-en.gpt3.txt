I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.
I told you that my grandmother had already passed away, and that I was now living with my aunt.
Among the body parts scattered around the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.
Just now you said that everyone has a time when they start their journey, as if their life has suddenly been put on a leash.
This cousin was her eldest son, and had always been an outcast in the family.
One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me.
We hooked them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Armed Guanyin.
Deep down, I felt that she should remain in pain and sorrow, just like me, due to my father's departure.
From then on, I no longer had a home.
The water delivery boy was standing outside, carrying a bucket of water, saying he was delivering it to a family in the western suburbs.
Our conversation was very difficult.
He wore a dirty gray woolen hat, and his expression was dazed.
"No," I replied.
You seemed to have noticed, but still kept trying to find a topic of conversation.
I don't know why, but even without seeing his face clearly, I could tell that he wasn't doing well.
You asked me if you looked different from what I had imagined.
Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist.
My grandmother had a younger sister who had gone to Beijing in her youth, and had gotten married and had children there.
That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing by himself.
Your mood was very low due to your parents' divorce.
It was no surprise that I couldn't recognize you after not seeing you for eighteen years.
The water in the stove was boiling, bubbling and rolling.
Mine was when I was eight.
My heart ached, and tears started to fall.
Every time we fell into a silence, I felt my heart being compressed, and I just wanted to end the meeting as soon as possible.
My father, in fact, had no idea how to do business, but he had gone to seek refuge with a distant cousin.
