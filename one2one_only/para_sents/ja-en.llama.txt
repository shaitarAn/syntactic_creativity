The small habits and mannerisms they displayed when we last met have probably flowed away to somewhere else.
The convenience store is filled with sound.
It seems like they've done this before, but I can't quite remember.

He quickly moved through the store and took a position near the register, standing tall and waiting for his turn without bothering the other customers.
"Welcome, good morning!"

Especially when eating sweets, they both have the habit of breaking off small pieces with their hands, which have been manicured with nail polish, and bringing them to their mouths.
