Whenever Mother scolded her for something ordinary, I would go up to Mother and ask why she was angry.
I wonder if the little quirks and mannerisms they had when I last saw them have already been swept away somewhere.
The convenience store is filled with sound.
I try to remember if they were always like this, but my memory is hazy.
"Should I get more?"
I quickly moved inside the store and slid into the cash register counter, standing inside to make sure I didn't keep the customer waiting.
"Welcome! Good morning!"
I quickly put a can of coffee, some cigarettes, and an Americano into a small bag.
I accepted the can of coffee that the male customer had offered me with a slight bow.
I could ask him if he wanted something else, but when he seemed to be hesitating about buying something, I decided to step back and wait.
His gesture told me that he was about to pay with an electronic money card.
At that moment, I felt I had become a part of the world.
Miho is now married and has bought an old house in her hometown, where her friends often gather.
Sure enough, there was a man with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand in his pocket, heading towards the register.
I was born as a normal part of the world, on this day.
At the sound of coins jingling, I turned my head towards the cash register.
Miho and Satsuki, who often meet in their hometown, have similar expressions and ways of speaking.
Most of the people who made this sound were buying cigarettes or newspapers and were about to leave, so I was sensitive to the sound of money.
My sister, perhaps thinking I had come to her rescue, would always thank me.
Meanwhile, the man who had been jingling coins in his pocket suddenly reached into his breast pocket, as if he had just thought of something.
Especially when they eat sweets, they break them into small pieces with their manicured hands and bring them to their mouths.
For two weeks, we practiced relentlessly, in pairs and with our colleagues, pretending to be customers.
"Please touch the screen for age verification."
We learned to smile and bow politely, to put sanitary items in paper bags, to separate hot and cold items, and to disinfect our hands with alcohol if we were asked for fast food.
