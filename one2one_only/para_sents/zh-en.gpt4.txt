I never thought that my mother would consider remarriage.
I told you that my grandmother has passed away, and I now live with my aunt.
Among those scattered body parts in the yard, a few more arms were added.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.
You just said that everyone has a time when their fate starts to take hold, as if life is suddenly reined in.
This cousin is her eldest son, and has always been seen as an odd one out in the entire family.
One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me.
We used hooks to pull them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin statue.
Maybe subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer over my father's departure, just like me.
After that, I no longer had a home.
The boy who delivers water was standing at my door front with a bucket in tow, saying he had to deliver water to a family in West Suburb.
Our conversation was tough.
He was wearing a dirty grey woolen hat and looked dazed.
"Yes," I answered.
You seemed to notice something but were still trying hard to find a topic of conversation.
I didn't know why, even though I couldn't see his face clearly, but it seemed as if he wasn't doing very well.
You asked me if your appearance is different than what I imagined.
Half a pot of water had evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist.
My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing when she was young and later got married and had children there.
That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
Your parents' divorce dampened your mood a lot.
It's been eighteen years since we last saw each other; it's no surprise I don't recognize you.
The water on the stove boiled and rolled with gurgling sounds.
It seems mine started at eight years old.
My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.
Each time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being oppressed and just wanted to end this meeting quickly.
In fact, my father knows nothing about doing business, he just went to join a cousin who he wasn't very familiar with.
