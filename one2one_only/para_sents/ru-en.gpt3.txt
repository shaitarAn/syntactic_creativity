But it rarely shone through the hazy white patch of mist, giving neither warmth nor shade.
"No," Grandpa replied.
Then one of them would start to quiver, make small circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away.
It lay on its side, flapping its fins.
Later, when we remembered the incident in Sturdzovskiy Lane, Yasha insisted that if you wanted to do something the best way, you always had to trip up on something insignificant.
It was a late, silent night, not a single star in the sky.
The river was roaring.
Then, far out at sea, a faint fire would flicker and go out.
He made it to the imperial capital and found out that she had died—perhaps she couldn't bear the separation.
Then she knelt down and fell face first onto the sand.
On the ceiling ran endless streams of light, gentle waves—reflections of the river.
The water would ripple, little buckets would be hurriedly paddled away in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glint would appear in the depths.
If there were people in the gateway, they might not notice us.
Only occasionally a solitary ray would cut through the thicket and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation.
My uncle Ilko and I went out to the bank.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before.
From there she saw her father being carried away.
The sun could not penetrate the thick foliage of this forest.
Yasha counted the seconds in his head.
At night, on the other side of the river, someone started to wave a flashlight and shout in a drawn-out voice.
I would scoop water from the pond, throw in some grass and wait.
And all the time someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other side of the river, but the words could not be distinguished over the noise of the river.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, the leaves lay scattered like pieces cut from a dull green velvet.
But if we went on the opposite side of the gateway, we might be seen from a distance.
My calculation, it seemed to me, was mathematically precise.
It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out onto the grassy bank a heavy carp, gasping for breath.
The red floats would stand motionless in the water.
When we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium.
We crept along the alley.
I, motionless, watched as it angrily buzzed and made its way out of the tight flower.
She stood motionless on the shore.
It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes fading away.
A line of ants ran along the iron gate, carrying off to their underground storehouses the last supplies for winter, and under the anchor chain lived a small, timid toad.
The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment.
I could tell by the smell of wet gravel and the barely audible quiver of a solitary plane leaf.
He had decided to go to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind.
On the opposite bank rose the forest of the Countess Branitskaya.
The wild freshness of the melted earth blew in our faces.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black—the mother.
The river was roaring nearby.
For example, in the rough yellow stone there were many tiny sea shells embedded in it; on the bushes of broom there were still a few flowers, sitting on straight, firm stalks like wet, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
In the morning I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls.
I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only wakeful friend.
The water was flowing through the rapids in a cold waterfall.
An amazing smell of the underwater kingdom emanated from its scales.
Ostop had started to go blind.
"That's true, they hadn't seen each other.
But it didn't go away, it was still here.
My father would set the hook, the line would tighten, the walnut rod would bend into an arc, and a bubbling, splashing and commotion would begin over the pond.
