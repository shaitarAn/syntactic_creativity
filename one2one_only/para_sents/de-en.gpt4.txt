When I was younger, I used to wrap my hand around her wrist after the stories, placing my thumb on her pulse and imagining that the whole world did everything in sync with Selma's heartbeat.
She put cheese on bread and put it in my lunchbox.
Selma still stood elevated in front of the kitchen bench.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, there were no stops in between.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved as if black ice had formed on all pathways, not only outdoors but also inside their homes black ice in their kitchens and living rooms.
All day long they lived with this underlying suspicion towards life itself and, when possible, that of others around them too.
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and fir trees.
They looked up regularly excluding the possibility of roof tiles falling down or branches or heavy lampshades knocking against something they stood under.
In first grade, I recited to Martin everything I saw during the journey and Martin tried to memorize it all.
"Do you remember when exactly you dreamt?"
She looked long at the dog.
"Well," I said, it could also have been a malformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the rust red color couldn't be recognized accurately in the night because everything was very blurry.
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she kept fidgeting around, she knocked off the cheese from the counter with her wrist by accident.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift ideas store.
Our mind works like this.
This always reliably lulled me to sleep but now at ten years old, Selma thought I was getting too old for that.
They moved as if they were strangers to their own bodies as if all of their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly combustible.
I imagined how the optician ground lenses, Martin lifted a weight, Elsbeth trimmed her hedge, how the retailer arranged juice boxes in shelves, my mother stacked fir branches one on top of another, my father stamped prescriptions and all of this happened exactly to Selma's heart rhythm.
That was true.
"Of course," Farmer Häubel would say, "please come in", and Death would enter.
On such days anything was possible Like an aged Dachshund potentially biting through one's throat perhaps more plausible than seeing an Okapi; it did not seem farfetched anymore .
"Around three o'clock," said Selma.
Three o'clock.
He imagined Death knocking gently, only opening the door a crack and asking "May I?" to which Farmer Häubel would naturally agree.
It can ensure in a very short time that the most outlandish things belong together firmly.
They weren't startled when an owl called at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled at night with its head lowered.
"We should probably not take this so seriously," Selma said but with an air of a detective who doesn't take anonymous letters too seriously.
Now still standing quietly at last , Selma gazed down at the packet of cheese as if it was something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
They kept looking behind them to see if someone would spring upon them with a murderous intent someone who had lost his mind therefore having nothing substantial left to lose; and turned quickly back around because someone bereft of sanity could obviously attack from the front too.
Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were mostly not superstitious.
He was sure that Death would not tear his life away from him, but gently take it from his hand.
He succeeded very well, so that in second grade I didn't list anything anymore and Martin, with his back to the window and eyes closed, could almost recite everything that I just saw through the fogged-up train window: "Wire factory," he said right at moment as we passed by a wire factory.
"What would you like on your sandwich today?", she trilled.
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that Death would be polite, just as Farmer Häubel himself had been all his life.
It'd apologize beforehand for its cold hands which wouldn't bother Farmer Häuble at all before placing one hand over his eyes.
"Little mouse," she added after it, and her trilling voice and 'little mouse' were indeed alarming.
The people in the village were disturbed, it was evident from their demeanor, even though most of them tried to hide it.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear claws, and we all knew what that meant.
He was completely right about that, and with it had unfortunately said more than he should have in response to the voices.
"Cowardice that was," said the optician, shifting his leather bag to the other hip as both nudging from his bag and nudging from those voices gradually began to hurt him.
When I slept downstairs at Selma's, she would tell me stories with happy endings by the side of the bed.
