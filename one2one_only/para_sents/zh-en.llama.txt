I never thought my mother would remarry.
I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt.
In the courtyard, there were more and more discarded body parts.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.
"Just as you said, everyone has their own time of luck, and life is like a roller coaster.
This cousin was the eldest son in their family and was always seen as an outsider within the entire clan.
On a cold afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me.
We used hooks to gather them up and arranged them into a thousand-handed Guanyin.
Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me.
From then on, I never had a home again."
The boy delivering water stood outside, holding a water tank and saying he had brought water for a household in the west suburbs.
Our conversation was going on with great difficulty.
He wore a dirty gray woolen hat and had a dazed expression.
"Yes," I replied.
You seemed to have noticed, but you were still trying to find a topic to talk about.
I don't know why, but even his appearance seemed strange and unfamiliar.
You ask me if your appearance is different from how I imagined it.
The water had already boiled half a pot, and the entire room was shrouded in white mist.
My grandmother had a younger sister who went to Beijing early on and later got married and had children there.
That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
The news of my parents' divorce had left you feeling down.
Eighteen years have passed, and it's no surprise that I don't recognize you.
The water on the stove is boiling and bubbling away.
Mine was when I was eight years old.
My heart ached, and tears streamed down my face.
Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart was being compressed, and I just wanted to quickly end this meeting.
My father didn't have much of a clue about doing business, he just went to work for a distant relative who wasn't very familiar to him.
