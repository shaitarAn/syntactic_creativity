Roszko got down from the cart and made a few grand farewells.
Many years later, in unknown circumstances, it arrived in Berlin, where it was subjected to detailed measurements and tests and declared to be an example of Jewish racial inferiority.
They had been in Iwan since April.
And yet!
All of the Offenbach neophytes were buried in the city cemetery, which however began to interfere with the city's expansion plans and was closed down in 1866.
And indeed, from somewhere to the left, from the clouds of fog, came a faint sound of water.
Many stalls sell beer here, and the better shops have both moonshine and mead in stock, mainly three-grain.
"I don't know where to go," he said.
Before long the priest relaxes into the rocking chair, stretching out his legs and letting his eyes wander over the sea of fog.
The woman hastily gathers them, as if she had just exposed her most intimate secrets to the world.
Suddenly she jumps, tugging at the reins, and if it weren't for Roszek's firm reaction and his whip, she would have overturned the carriage.
I also told him about Chai Szor that she was the only woman I could love and I had loved her since that beautiful moment when I got her for one night, when I had come to Rohatyn with news of Jakub.
If it hadn't been for the kind people of Iwan, they would have probably perished from hunger.
From beneath his festive red, though somewhat faded, kubrak emerged a shirt.
He immediately falls into a travel-induced reverie, for it is in motion that man's thoughts best take shape.
A bundle she had on her back falls and a few faded rags and a single string of beads, small and darkened, spill out of it.
After all, the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius maintains that the world was created in the autumn, during the autumn equinox.
At this occasion the skull of Jacob Frank was removed from the grave and, carefully described as "the skull of a Jewish patriarch", ended up in the hands of an Offenbach historian.
He was born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, and became one of the best lawyers and legal experts of the time.
They would get a piece of land, Bejla would have vegetables in her garden, and he, Srol, would weave kilims, because he was good at that.
"Shh!" the priest suddenly said, raising his finger and listening.
The most to be said would be about the Wołowski family, as it had grown to immense proportions.
As they approach the main road leading to Rohatyna, they join the stream of pedestrians, horse riders and all kinds of carts emerging from the mist, like figures made of bread dough for Christmas.
Almost all the branches of this family had been ennobled, one with the Bawół coat of arms, the other with the Na Kaskach coat of arms.
The peasants also bring goats and cows for sale the animals, terrified by the commotion, stumble in the puddles.
Iwan had saved their lives and health, Bejla felt better now and didn't cough as much.
When they got old and their daughters were married off, they would take them in.
Those were all his dreams.
After the war it disappeared without a trace perhaps destroyed in the war chaos, turned to dust, or still lying in the underground storage of some museum.
She kneels by the boy, grabs him by the wrists, and he looks at her with his eyes full of tears, still smiling, a little rascal.
There's something to it.
She automatically, but solemnly, responds: "For ever and ever, amen."
Srol believed that once they were baptized, they would be as well off as the Christians.
Interestingly, when the motion to grant Polish citizenship to Jews was presented to the Sejm, Franciszek, as a member of parliament, argued in his passionate speech that it was not yet the time for such a step.
The first buildings start to appear before them, suddenly, without warning.
Then he bent down and peered into the fog, as if looking into water.
He watches a family, all girls, as the mother with a child at her breast clumsily gets off the cart and the driver hurries her, for the cart has to go back to the suburbs to pick up others.
First the Polish nation must win its independence, and then it will be time for social reforms.
After Jakub's death, I experienced a time of great peace.
My main occupation became studying the merkava, to which were added our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, since we were living in the same room, which brought us closer together.
"Look, sir, Kaska doesn't want to go," Roszko said gloomily as the carriage stopped.
Any moment now it will chime bim-bam.
And she clutches her heart and tears fill her eyes.
The Jewish merchant Wakszul's store offers wine, real Hungarian and real Rhine, and some slightly sour stuff they bring all the way from Transylvania.
In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babińce, there are a few small breweries, from which the nourishing aroma spreads across the whole area.
He starts to wonder if the world hadn't come from such a fog.
But above all, I had loved Jakub.

The fog seems to distort the sense of distance, for Kasia seems taken aback by it.
