But it rarely emerged from the fog as a faint white blotch, providing neither warmth nor shade.
No, replied grandfather.
Suddenly, one of them started trembling, making small circles, quickly diving or swimming away.
It lay on its side, panting and moving its fins.
Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzo Street, Yasha claimed that he always did his best to make a mess of things.
It was a late, silent night, not a single star was visible above.
The river was roaring.
Then, far out at sea, a faint light flickered and went out.
He reached the capital and found out that she had died, maybe she couldn't bear the separation.
Then she knelt down and fell face down onto the sand.
Sunlit streams flowed endlessly across the ceiling, light waves reflecting the river's murmur.
The water churned, the cups of the water-measuring beetles hastily scattered in all directions, and finally, a golden glimmer appeared in the depths.
If there are people in the archway, they might not even notice us.
Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light slice through the canopy, revealing before us the stunning power of vegetation.
I went out with my uncle Ilko to the riverbank.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover in them many previously unnoticed qualities.
She saw from there how they were carrying my father.
The sun was unable to penetrate the dense foliage of this forest.
Yasha thought to himself for a few seconds.
Someone on the other side of the river started flashing a light and shouting loudly at night.
I scooped water from the pond into a bucket, threw in some grass, and waited.
And all the time, someone on the other side was flashing a light and shouting, but the words were inaudible over the river's noise.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, the leaves lay like cut-out pieces of dull green velvet.
However, if we were to walk on the opposite side from the archway, we may be spotted from a distance.
The plan, in my opinion, was mathematically precise.
It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp on a tangled line.
The red poppies stood motionless in the water.
When we passed by the entrance, Yasha stumbled.
We knew that it took seven minutes to walk from Sturdzo Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium.
We were creeping through the alley.
I watched, mesmerized, as it angrily buzzed and struggled to escape from the tight flower.
She was standing motionless on the bank.
It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
Along the cast-iron gutter,a procession of ants carried their last supplies for the winter,while near the anchor chain,a small timid frog lived.
The endless sea roar did not subside for a minute.
I knew it by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf.
He thought he would go to Petersburg to see that woman before he went completely blind.
On the opposite bank, the preserved forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope.
The wind was blowing fiercely, carrying the freshness of thawed earth.
When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black my mother.
The river was right nearby, its gentle rumble echoing through the air.
In the yellow, noseless stone, there were many small, tightly embedded sea shells, while on the branches of the drooping bushes, there were still a few faded colors, like damp, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
In the morning, I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls.
I had noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
The water was flowing through the dam as a cold waterfall.
From its scales came an amazing smell of "the underwater kingdom".
Ostap began to get blind.
It's true, we haven't seen each other.
But it didn't go away, it was here.
My father cast his line, the fishing rod bent into an arc, and in the mist above the pond, a mysterious commotion began.
