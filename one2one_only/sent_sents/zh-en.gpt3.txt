I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.
I'm telling you, Grandma has passed away and now I'm living with my aunt.
Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms.
The most important thing that happened to me in the winter of 1993 was that my father came back, just the week before my mother's wedding.
That feeling gave me a chill down my spine.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.
I tried hard to recall, the cards of memory flipping over in my mind.
You just said that everyone has a time of departure, and life suddenly seems to be harnessed.
This cousin of hers was the eldest son in the family, and had always been an outcast in the entire family.
One afternoon in December, he came to the school looking for me.
I opened my eyes.
We used hooks to gather them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Handed Guanyin.
From then on, I no longer had a home.
Just as I shut the door, I felt a sense of relief, but then the doorbell rang again.
"She never got married," you asked.
You sat down awkwardly, watching me pour tea.
Perhaps deep down, I thought she must have been suffering the same way I was, due to my father's departure.
The water delivery boy stood at the gate with a bucket of water, saying he was going to deliver it to a family in the western suburbs.
Our conversation was difficult.
He wore a dirty gray woolen cap and had a dazed expression.
"Hmm."
You seem to have noticed, but are still trying to find something to talk about.
For some reason, I couldn't even make out his features, but I could tell that he was not doing well.
You asked me if you looked different than I had imagined.
Half a pot of water had evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist.
You stand at the threshold.
For me, everything related to you has been put into a file folder and sealed with lacquer.
That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
The divorce of your parents has taken a toll on your emotions.
It had been eighteen years since we had last seen each other, so it was no surprise that we didn't recognize each other.
The water in the pot was boiling and bubbling.
And then you said, you were Li Jiaqi.
I must have been eight years old.
My heart ached and tears rolled down my cheeks.
Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being crushed and just wanted the meeting to end quickly.
It may be hurtful to say this, but I really didn't expect to see you again.
