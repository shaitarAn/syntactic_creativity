When I was younger, I used to take hold of her wrist after the stories, place my thumb on her pulse, and imagine that the entire world was doing everything in time with Selma's heartbeat.
She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it up, and placed it in my lunchbox.
Selma was still standing in front of the kitchen counter.
Platform two.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops along the way.
This morning, a few hours after Selma's dream, the people in the village moved as if lightning ice had formed on all paths, not only outside, but also in the houses, lightning ice in the kitchens and living rooms.
All day long they kept a watchful eye on their own lives, and on everyone else's, as much as they could.
Lookout point one.
For example, coffee pots and shoelaces, or bottles for deposits and Christmas trees.
They looked up to avoid any falling roof tiles, branches, or heavy lampshades.
In the first class, I had listed for Martin all the things I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize them all.
"Do you know when exactly you had that dream?"
She looked at the dog for a long time.
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and since she was still slouching, she pushed the cheese off the counter with her wrist.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop.
Our minds work this way.
I had always reliably fallen asleep to this, but now, at ten years old, Selma said I was too old for it.
They moved as if their own bodies were foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly combustible.
The optician was now slowing down.
I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the shopkeeper stocking juice bags, my mother stacking pine branches, my father stamping recipes, and all of them doing it in perfect time with Selma's heart rhythm.
That's true.
"Of course," Bauer Häubel would say, "come right in," and Death would enter.
"Around three o'clock," said Selma.
Three o'clock.
He imagined Death knocking cautiously, opening the door only a crack and asking "May I?", to which Bauer Häubel would naturally answer yes.
He can make the most disparate things belong together in the shortest amount of time.
They were not startled when the owl called out at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled with its head bowed at night.
"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously," Selma said, but she said it like a TV detective who isn't taking an anonymous letter too seriously.
Selma now remained silent and looked down at the cheese package, as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
They avoided all animals, believing that evil spirits could escape from them more quickly than from humans.
Again and again they looked behind them to check if someone was coming after them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and thus had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked forward again, because someone without a mind could just as well attack them head-on.
Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, most people in the village were not superstitious.
He was certain that death would not snatch his life away, but would take it gently from his hand.
The way to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly seemed to him like a day's journey, a day's journey with a lot, a lot of baggage.
This went very well, so that in the second school year I no longer had to list anything, and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything I saw through the fogged-up train window: "Wire factory," he said, just as we were passing the wire factory.
"What would you like on your school sandwich today?" she cooed.
They hung laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, was considered superstitious to be equivalent to suicide or aiding in murder.
Woodland.
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as Farmer Häubel had been all his life.
He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which Bauer Häubel knew would not bother him at all, and then he would place a hand over Bauer Häubel's eyes.
"Mousie," she trilled after him, and trilling and "Mousie" were truly alarming.
The people in the village were uneasy, it was visible on their faces, even though most of them tried to hide it.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as a bear's, and we all knew what that meant.
He was absolutely right, but unfortunately he had said more than he should have in response to the voices.
"That was cowardice," said the optician, shifting the leather satchel to the other hip, as the jostling of the bag and the jostling of the voices were beginning to hurt.
When I slept downstairs with Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at the edge of the bed.
