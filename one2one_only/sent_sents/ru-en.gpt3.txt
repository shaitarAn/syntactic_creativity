The father was winding the line, the nut-wood rod was bending into an arc, and in the mist above the pond there was a buzzing, splashing and commotion.
Red and yellow pansies swayed outside the open window.
But it rarely emerged in the mist as a blurry white patch, giving neither warmth nor shade.
They chased each other with a squeal and dove into the foliage, as if into green water.
Like sparkling dust, small birds flew into this ray of light.
No, Grandfather replied.
He was lying on his side, drifting and flapping his fins.
I calculated that in the last case we would be going against a dangerous alleyway, or rather, we would be visible to the people hiding in the alleyway for five times longer.
Then, when we remembered the incident in the Sturdzov alley, Yasha insisted that if you want to do something in the best way, you will always fail on a trifle.
It was a late, silent night, and not a single star was visible in the sky.
The river was roaring.
Then far out at sea a dim light flickered and went out.
He arrived at the royal capital and found out that she had died perhaps she could not bear the separation.
Then she knelt down and fell with her head on the sand.
Streams of light ran endlessly across the ceiling, gentle waves reflections of the river.
If there are people in the alleyway, they may not even notice us.
Only occasionally a solitary ray of light pierced through the thicket and revealed to us the astonishing power of vegetation.
I went out to the shore with my uncle Ilko.
He would make us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before.
She saw from there how they were taking her father away.
The sun could not penetrate through the thick foliage of this forest.
Yasha counted the seconds to himself.
At night on the other side of the river someone started waving a flashlight and shouting in a drawn-out voice.
Occasionally, shots from a rifle could be heard coming from the darkness of the city.
I was scooping water from the pond into a bucket, throwing in some grass, and waiting.
And all the time someone was waving a flashlight on the other bank and shouting, but the words were lost in the noise of the river.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, leaves were lying about as if cut out of a dull green velvet.
If we go in the opposite direction from the alley, we can be seen from a distance.
I believe the calculation was mathematically accurate.
It was impossible to tell what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp from the grass he had baited.
The red floats stood still in the water.
As we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium.
Amen!"
We crept along the alley.
I stood still, watching as she angrily wriggled and freed herself from the tight flower.
She stood motionless on the shore.
I said that we should go on the other side of the gateway, not reaching it, stop and listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass by the gateway.
It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying and sometimes subsiding.
Ants were running in a line through the iron gate, carrying away the last supplies for winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment.
I knew this from the smell of wet pebbles and the barely audible rustle of a solitary maple leaf.
But he didn't leave, he was here.
I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything.
He had the idea of travelling to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind.
On the other shore, the Countess Branitskaya's reserved forest rose up the slope.
But I kept quiet so as not to upset Yasha.
Therefore, there will be five times more chances for us to be noticed.
A wild freshness blew in his face, melted from the earth.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black the mother.
The river was roaring nearby.
In the morning I would wake up from the hot sun beating against the white walls.
After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time.
I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only lively companion.
The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall.
That woman bequeathed to have a rose placed on her grave.
From his scales emanated an amazing smell of the underwater kingdom.
Ostap started to go blind.
"That's right, we haven't seen each other.
Then one of them would start to flinch, let out light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away.
The water was spreading, rocking the buckets, water beetles were scurrying off in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glimmer appeared in the depths.
