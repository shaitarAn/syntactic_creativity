When I was younger, after the stories, I always grasped her wrist, put my thumb on her pulse and imagined that the whole world did everything to the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat.
She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it over and put it in my lunchbox.
Selma still stood upright in front of the kitchen bench.
High seat two.
The train ride took fifteen minutes, there were no stops.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, people in the village were moving as if black ice had formed on all paths, not only outside but also inside the houses, black ice in the kitchens and living rooms.
They distrusted their own life the whole day long and, as far as possible, everyone else's.
High seat one.
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and Christmas trees.
They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles, branches or heavy lampshades.
In the first grade, I told Martin what I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize everything.
Do you know exactly when you dreamed that?
She looked at the dog for a long time.
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and because she was still flailing about, she knocked the cheese off the counter with her wrist.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift idea store.
Our mind works like this.
I always reliably fell asleep to that, but now, at the age of ten, Selma thought I was too old for it.
They moved as if their own bodies were completely alien to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable.
The optician is now slowing down.
I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting a weight, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the retailer stocking juice boxes, my mother stacking spruce branches, my father stamping prescriptions, and all doing so in sync with Selma's heartbeat.
That was true.
"Of course," Farmer Häubel would say, "please come in," and Death would enter.
"Around three o'clock," Selma said.
Three o'clock.
He imagined Death knocking gently, only opening the door a crack and asking, "May I?", to which Farmer Häubel would naturally agree.
He can ensure in the shortest possible time that the most disparate things belong tightly together.
They were not frightened when the screech owl called at night, when a horse in the stable broke out in heavy sweat, when a dog howled at night with its head lowered.
"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously," Selma said, but she said it like a television detective who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously.
Selma now stood still and looked down at the cheese package, as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
They avoided all animals, because they believed it could break out faster from them than from humans.
Again and again they looked behind them, checking to see if anyone was coming at them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing significant left to lose, and they quickly looked forward again because someone without a mind could also attack from the front.
Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were mostly not superstitious.
He was certain that death would not snatch life away from him, but would gently take it from his hand.
The journey to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly felt like a day's travel, a day's travel with very, very much luggage.
That worked out really well, so that by the second year of school I no longer had to list anything and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could recite almost everything I was seeing through the fogged up train window: "Wire factory," he said, just as we were passing the wire factory.
"What would you like on your sandwich for school today?", she trilled.
They hung laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, in superstition equates to suicide or aiding and abetting murder.
Piece of forest.
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as Farmer Häubel himself had been his entire life.
He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which, as Farmer Häubel knew, would not bother him at all, and then place a hand on Farmer Häubel's eyes.
"Little mouse," she cooed after him, and the cooing and the term "little mouse" were indeed alarming.
The people in the village were uneasy, you could see it on them, even though they mostly tried not to show it.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear paws, and we all knew what that meant.
He was completely right about that, and unfortunately, he said more than he should have responded to the voices.
"That was cowardice," said the optician, shifting the leather bag to his other hip because the jostling of the bag and the jostling of voices were slowly beginning to hurt.
When I slept downstairs at Selma's, she would tell me bedtime stories with happy endings.
