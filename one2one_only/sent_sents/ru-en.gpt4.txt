Father was reeling in, the fishing line was tightening, the walnut rod bent into an arc, and over the pond in the fog there began a bubbling, splashing, hustle.
Red and yellow hollyhocks swayed behind the open window.
But it very rarely appeared in the fog as a blurred white spot, providing neither warmth nor shadow.
They squealed as they chased each other and dove into the foliage, as if it were green water.
Like sparkling specks of dust, little birds flew into this ray.
No, the grandfather replied.
He was lying on his side, catching his breath, and fluttering his fins.
I calculated that in the last case we would be moving against a dangerous blind alley, or rather, we would be in sight of people hiding in the alley five times longer.
Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzovsky lane, Yasha claimed that every time you want to do something in the best possible way, you are bound to stumble over a trifle.
The night was late, deafening, not a single star overhead.
The river roared.
Then a dim light flickered far out at sea and went out.
He reached the imperial capital and found out that she had died, presumably unable to bear the separation.
Then she knelt down and fell headfirst into the sand.
Endless bright streaks ran across the ceiling, light waves reflecting off the river.
If there are people in the alley, they might not notice us.
Only occasionally a solitary ray cut through the thicket at an angle, revealing to us the stunning power of vegetation.
I went to the shore with my uncle Ilko.
He made us look at these things more closely and longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that we had not noticed before.
She saw from there as they took her father away.
The sun could not break through the dense greenery of this forest.
Yasha was counting the seconds to himself.
At night, on the other side of the river, someone started waving a lantern and shouting loudly.
Occasionally, rifle shots echoed out of the darkness, out of the city.
I was filling a bucket with water from the pond, throwing grass into this water, and waiting.
And all the time someone on the other bank waved a lantern and shouted, but the words couldn't be made out over the noise of the river.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon spots on the trunk, leaves lay as if cut out of dull green velvet.
However, if we go on the opposite side from the alleyway, we might be spotted from a distance.
The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically precise.
It was impossible to figure out what it was until the father dragged a heavy crucian onto the trampled grass.
The red floats stood motionless in the water.
As we were passing by the gateway, Yasha tripped.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzevsky Lane to the Landesman Sanatorium.
Amen!
We stealthily went down the alley.
I watched, frozen, as she angrily retreated and extracted herself from the tight flower.
She stood motionless on the shore.
I said that we need to go on the side where the archway is, stop just before reaching it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently dart past the archway.
He ran in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
Through the iron gate, ants ran in a line, carrying their last reserves for the winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
The boundless sea noise did not stop for a minute.
I knew this by the smell of wet pebble and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf.
But he didn't leave, he was here.
I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything.
He decided then to go all the way to St. Petersburg to see that woman before he completely lost his sight.
On that shore, the countess Branicka's protected forest rose up the slope.
But I kept silent so as not to upset Yasha.
And, therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed.
The face was blasted with the wild freshness of the expanse, of the thawed earth.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses unharnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black mourning attire.
The river roared right here, nearby.
In the morning, I was awakened by the hot sun hitting the white walls.
After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time.
I noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall.
<ERROR>
His scales gave off an amazing scent of the underwater kingdom.
Ostap began to lose his sight.
That's true, we haven't seen each other.
Then one of them would start shivering, would make light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim aside.
The water rippled, rocking the lily pads, the water beetles hurriedly scurried in all directions, and finally a pulsating golden glow appeared in the mysterious depths.
