I never thought my mother would have the idea of remarrying.
I tell you, grandma has passed away, and now I'm living with my aunt.
In the courtyard, there were several more chicken wings scattered among the various body parts.
In the winter of 1993, the most important thing to me was my father's return, which happened just a week before my mother's wedding.
That feeling sends a chill down my spine.
I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.
I strive to recall, and the memories flood my mind like a deck of cards shuffling through.
"You just said that everyone has a time to get lucky, and life seems to suddenly put on the reins."
This man is the eldest son of the family and has always been an outcast within the entire clan.
One afternoon in December, he came to the school to look for me.
I open my eyes.
We used hooks to pull them together and created a thousand-hand Guanyin.
After that, I never had a home again.
I just closed the door and felt a sense of relief, when the doorbell rang again.
She never got married.

Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should have been suffering all along because of my father's departure, just like me.

Hmm.
You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic to talk about.
"I don't know why, but I couldn't even see his face clearly, and I just felt that he was not doing well."
"You ask me, your appearance is not the same as I imagined."
The water has already evaporated half a bowl, and the entire room is enveloped in white mist.
You are standing in the doorway.
As far as I'm concerned, everything related to you has been packed away in a file and sealed with wax.
That autumn, Father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
Your parents' divorce has left you feeling emotionally drained.
Eighteen years have passed, it's not strange that I don't recognize you.
The water on the stove is boiling, bubbling and churning away.
"Then you say, you are Li Qianyuan."
I should have been eight years old.
My heart is sour, and tears have fallen out.
Every time I fall into silence, I feel my heart is oppressed, and I just want to quickly end this meeting.
"I may have hurt someone's feelings by saying this, but I really haven't been looking forward to seeing you again."
