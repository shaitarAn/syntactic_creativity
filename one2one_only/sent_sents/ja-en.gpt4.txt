When my sister was being scolded by our mother for something ordinary, unlike me, I approached my mother and asked why she was angry.
I sometimes think that the little habits and gestures of the two people we used to be when we met before may have already drifted off somewhere.
The convenience store is filled with sound.
Everything blends together, becoming the sounds of the convenience store, constantly touching my eardrums.
I try to remember if it was always like this, but my memory is vague.
Should I get more?
Quickly moving around the store, they slide their body behind the cash register counter and stand waiting inside so as not to keep customers waiting.
I thought I was born just now.
Put canned coffee, cigarettes, and corn dogs into a small size bag quickly.
From that gesture, I instantly judged that they were going to make a payment with electronic money.
At that moment, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time.

Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family home in her hometown, where her friends often gather.
As I watched the man's gaze smoothly shift to the showcase filled with fast food while touching the screen, I stopped moving my finger.
As expected, there was a man approaching the cash register with a can of coffee in one hand and the other hand stuck in his pocket.
As a normal part of the world, I was indeed born on this day.
I turned around in response to the faint sound of loose change, diverting my gaze towards the cash register.
Perhaps because Miho and Satsuki often meet in their hometown, they have strikingly similar expressions and ways of speaking.
People who jingle change in their hands or pockets are often those who are looking to quickly buy cigarettes or a newspaper and return home, so they are sensitive to the sound of money.
After the lecture ended because of the question I asked my mother, my little sister always thanked me, as if she thought she was shielded by me.
During that time, the man who had been jingling the coins in his pocket suddenly seemed to have an idea and put his hand into his breast pocket.
Their ways of eating sweets are particularly similar, both delicately breaking cookies into smaller pieces with their manicured hands before bringing them to their mouths.
For the two weeks leading up to the opening, persistent practice continued with people pairing up, dealing with employees, and addressing imaginary customers.
"Please touch for age confirmation."
It's sad that your friend passed away, isn't it?
