The father was fishing, the line was tightening, the willow branch was bending into an arc, and in the mist over the pond, bubbles began to rise, splashing, and commotion.
The red and yellow marigolds swayed in the open window.
But it rarely emerged from the fog as a dim white patch and failed to provide either warmth or shade.
They squealed as they chased after each other and dived into the foliage, as if into green water.
Like sparkling dust particles, small birds flew into this ray of light.
No, replied grandfather.
He lay on his side, exhaled, and waved his fins.
I calculated that in the latter case, we will be going against a dangerous current, or rather, we will be in plain sight of the people who have taken cover in the underpass, for five times longer.
Afterwards, when we recalled the incident in Sturdza Lane, Yasha insisted that whenever you want to do something in the best possible way, you will inevitably mess up on something trivial.
The night was late, dark, and starless overhead.
The river roared.
A dim light flickered and died far out at sea.
He reached the royal capital and learned that she had died, perhaps unable to bear the separation.
She fell to her knees and dropped her head onto the sand.
Bright streams were running endlessly across the ceiling, light waves of river reflection.
If there are people in the entrance, they may not notice us.
Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light break through the dense foliage and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation.
I went out with Uncle Vanya to the shore.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many previously unnoticed qualities in them.
She saw them taking her father away.
The sun could not break through the dense foliage of this forest.
Yasha thought about himself for seconds.
At night, someone on the other side of the river started flashing a flashlight and shouting prolongedly.
Occasionally, from the darkness, from the city, gunshots could be heard.
I scooped water from the pond, threw in some grass, and waited.
And all the time, someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other bank, but the words were inaudible over the noise of the river.
Under a single ancient plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, leaves lay scattered, as if cut from dull green velvet.
If we walk on the opposite side of the alley, they may notice us from afar.
The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically accurate.
It was impossible to understand what it was until the father pulled out a heavy carp from the tangled grass.
The red buoys stood motionless in the water.
As we were passing by the gate, Yasha stumbled.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdza Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium.
Amen!
We were crawling through the alley.
I, frozen, watched as she angrily struggled and extricated herself from the tight flower.
She stood motionless on the bank.
I said that we should go along the side where the gap is, not stopping short of it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass through the gap.
He was advancing in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
Along the iron railings, a procession of ants scurried, carrying their last supplies for the winter in their underground dwellings, while a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
The deafening sea roar never ceased for a minute.
I knew it by the smell of damp earth and the faint tremble of a solitary plane tree leaf.
But he didn't leave, he was here.
I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything.
He decided to go to St. Petersburg then, to see that woman before he became completely blind.
On the other bank, the forbidden forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope.
But I kept silent not to upset Yasha.
And therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed.
The face was splashed with the freshness of the wild, thawed earth.
When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black.
The river murmured here, right next to us.
I woke up in the morning to the hot sun beating on the white walls.
After each shot, the dogs would bark for a long time.
I noticed that stubborn gray sheet during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
The water flowed through the dam as a cold waterfall.
The woman bequeathed to lay a rose on her grave.
From his scales emanated a wonderful smell of the underwater kingdom.
Ostap began to go blind.
It's true, we haven't seen each other.
One of them started to twitch, made light circles, suddenly dived or quickly swam away.
Water was splashing, jostling the cups, hastily scurrying in all directions were the water-measuring beetles, and finally, in the mysterious depths, a golden glow began to flicker.
