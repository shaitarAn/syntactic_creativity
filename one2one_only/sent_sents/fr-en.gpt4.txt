The coarse cloth of the tunic, brushed when one would rise on tiptoe to kiss them, materialized the absolute break between the world of men and that of women.
Between the fair and the fete, the commercial fortnight established itself as a springtime ritual.
The two photos were taken on the same day in front of a low wall topped with a border of flowers, in a paved courtyard.
