I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.
I told you, grandma has passed away, now I live with my aunt.
In the yard, several more arms have been added to the scattered body parts.
In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my dad came back, just one week before my mom was to be married.
That kind of feeling sends a chill down one's spine.
I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.
I am trying hard to recall, with the cards of memory flipping over and over in my mind.
You just said that everyone has a time when their fortune begins, it's as if life suddenly takes the reins.
This cousin is the eldest son of her family, and has always been considered an outcast within the entire clan.
One afternoon in December, he came to school to look for me.
I open my eyes.
We used hooks to bring them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin.
Since then, I haven't had a home anymore.
I had just closed the door and let out a sigh of relief when the doorbell rang again.
"She never settled down," you ask.
You sit down restlessly, watching me pour the tea.
Perhaps subconsciously, I feel that she should continue to suffer because of my dad's departure, just like me.
The boy carrying the water bucket stood at the doorway, saying he was delivering water to a household in the western suburbs.
Our conversation is going very difficultly.
He is wearing a dirty, grey wool hat, with a dazed expression on his face.
Hmm.
You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic.
I don't know why, even though I didn't get a clear look at him, I feel like he's not doing well.
You ask me, are you different from the way I imagined you?
Half of the water in the kettle has evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist.
You are standing at the door.
For me, everything related to you has already been packed into a file bag and sealed with sealing wax.
That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
The matter of your parents' divorce is making you feel very depressed.
It's been eighteen years, so it's not strange if you don't recognize me.
The water on the stove is boiling, gurgling and rolling over.
Then you said, you are Li Jiaqi.
I think I was about eight years old.
My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.
Every time I fall into silence, I feel a pressure on my heart, just wanting to end this meeting quickly.
It might hurt to say this, but honestly, I really have no desire to see you again.
