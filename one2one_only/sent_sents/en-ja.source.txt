The sun was almost free.
They were almost at the water tank, at the smile.
'Were they the ones who made those wagon wheels?
He splattered his black trouser legs and the farmer's jeans.
'There weren't any sheep over here,' the farmer said, ignoring the question.
'Where are they?'
Chalky rocks littered the plot in every direction.
His voice drifted.
Fifty feet away, the field gave way to freshly tilled brown soil, forming mounds everywhere on the uneven earth.
They'd mix sausage meat into a kind of well, kind of cinnamon swirl, I suppose.
They were alone.
'Chemtrails,' the farmer had said to Alec, early on their walk.
He leapt over the bank, his boots slipping slightly on the incline.
'You won't fall,' he said.
The day had almost begun.
With that thick wax coat and that gut and that voice, he could have been a lunatic Santa Claus.
The other man tutted, smiling.

'I just hope you aren't wasting my time.
Other than this, he had been silent.
His palms grew filthy.
'What have we come to, eh?'
And these flies ...'
He knew few out here.
He stepped back, tensing before rushing over the ditch.
Alec asked, shivering.
Alec grimaced.
The farmer walked on.
'Not afraid of a little dirt, are you, Sergeant Nichols?'
Alec brushed at the muck around his ankles, but this only spread it further.
It's delicious.
The lady who lives down the lane,' the farmer said, frowning.
Each step in this place was as muddy and wet as the last.
'No,' the farmer said.
