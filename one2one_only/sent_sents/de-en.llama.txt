When I was younger, I would always grasp her wrist after the stories, place my thumb on her pulse and imagine that the whole world did everything in the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat.
She placed a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it together, and put it in my butter bread box.
Selma still stood upright in front of the kitchen counter.
High seat two.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, there was no stop.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved about as if black ice had formed on all paths, not only outside, but also in the houses black ice in the kitchens and living rooms.
They spent the whole day grumbling about their own lives and, as far as possible, those of others.
"High seat one."
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and Christmas trees.
They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles, branches, or heavy lampshades.
In the first class, I listed to Martin what I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize everything.
Do you know exactly when you dreamed that?
She looked at the dog for a long time.
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as it was still slippery, she pushed the cheese off the cutting board with her wrist.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop.
Our understanding works that way.
I have always relied on it to fall asleep, but now, at ten years old, Selma thinks I'm too old for it.
They moved as if their own bodies were completely foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable.
The optician became slower.
I pictured the optician polishing lenses, Martin exerting himself, Elsbeth cutting her hedge, the retailer packing juice boxes, my mother layering fir branches, my father stamping recipes, and everyone doing it in perfect sync with Selma's heartbeat.
That was correct.
"Of course," Bauer Häubel would say, "just step inside," and death would ensue.
"At three o'clock," said Selma.
Three o'clock.
He imagined how death would knock cautiously, open the door only a crack, and ask "May I?" which farmer Häubel would naturally answer in the affirmative.
He can ensure that the most disparate things belong together in no time.
They did not shudder when the owl cried at night, when a horse sweated profusely in the stable, when a dog howled with its head lowered.
"We should probably not take this too seriously," said Selma, but she said it like a TV commissioner who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously.
Selma held still and gazed down at the cheese packaging as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
They feared all animals because they believed they could break out of them more quickly than out of humans.
They kept looking back to check if someone was creeping up on them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked back to the front again because someone without a mind could also attack head-on.
Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were not superstitious.
He was certain that death would not snatch life away from him, but rather take it gently from his hand.
The way to Selma's house, which actually took ten minutes, suddenly seemed to him like a day trip, a day trip with an awful lot of luggage.
That worked out very well, so that in the second school year, I didn't have to list anything anymore, and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything that I saw through the fogged-up train window: "Wire factory," he said, exactly at the moment when we passed by the wire factory.
"What's allowed to be on the sandwich today?" she piped.
They hung laundry out between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, is considered a superstition akin to suicide or murder.
"wooded area" or "forest patch"
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just like Farmer Häubel had been throughout his life.
He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which, Bauer Häubel knew, would not affect him at all, and then place a hand on Bauer Häubel's eyes.
"Little mouse," she whistled after it, and the flute and the mouse were now really alarming.
The villagers were uneasy, it was plain to see, even though they mostly tried to hide it.
His body was still small, but his paws were large as bear's paws, and we all knew what that meant.
He was completely right, and he unfortunately said more than he should have replied to the voices.
"Cowardice was it," said the optician, shifting the leather bag to the other hip, as the rustling of the bag and the rustling of voices began to grate on him.
When I was sleeping with Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at bedtime.
