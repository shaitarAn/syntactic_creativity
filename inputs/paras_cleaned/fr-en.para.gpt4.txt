Two other small photos with scalloped edges, likely from the same year, show the same thin child in a dress with frills and puff sleeves. In the first picture, she mischievously snuggles against a heavy-set woman, entirely draped in a wide striped dress, her hair up in large rolls. In the other picture, she lifts her left fist; her right is held by the hand of a tall man in a light jacket and creased trousers, adopting a nonchalant posture. Both photos were taken on the same day in front of a low wall topped with flower beds in a paved courtyard. Above their heads there's clothesline with one pin still clipped on it.
Another photo, credited to the same photographer but the paper of the booklet is more ordinary and the gold trim has disappeared â€”, likely destined for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of about four years old, serious, almost sad despite a good round face under short hair, parted in the middle and pulled back by barrettes to which ribbons are attached, like butterflies. The left hand rests on the same carved table, fully visible in Louis XVI style. She appears plump in her blouse; her suspender skirt pulls up at front due to a protruding belly perhaps a sign of rickets (circa 1944).
The boys were proud to join the regiment and they looked handsome in their uniforms. On the evening of their enlistment, they made their round of local cafes to celebrate the glory of being recognized as real men. Before joining the regiment, they were just kids and held no value in the world of work and marriage. Afterwards, they could have a wife and children. The uniform that they wore on leave draped them in patriotic beauty and assumed sacrifice. The shadow of victorious soldiers, GIs, lingered around them. The roughness of the uniform tunic felt when one had to stand on tiptoes to kiss them underlined a stark divide between the worlds' men and women inhabit. Seeing them inspired a sense of heroism.
Beneath the unchanging, the last year's circus posters with Roger Lanzac's photo, the first communion pictures distributed to classmates, the Club des Chansonniers on Radio Luxembourg, days were filled with new desires. On Sunday afternoons, people thronged at the window of the general electricity store in front of the television. Cafes invested in a set to attract customers. Motorcross tracks wound their way up and down hillsides and you could watch noisy vehicles go up and down all day long. The growing impatience of commerce with its new catchwords "initiative", "dynamism", shook city routines out of their complacency. Between fairground attractions and church festivals, commercial fortnights established themselves  as a spring ritual. Through downtown streets loudspeakers blared exhortations to buy interspersed with songs by Annie Cordy and Eddie Constantine in order to win Simca or dining room furniture prizes. On stage at City Hall Square a local host cheered crowds with jokes from Roger Nicolas and Jean Richard while recruiting contestants for Hook or Double or Nothing just like on radio shows.. Seated in one corner of stage under her crown sat Commerce Queen.. Goods moved amidst festival colors... People said it was "changing," that you should not get stuck in a rut because it is mind-numbing staying home alone.
But they only talked about what they had seen, which could be relived by eating and drinking. They did not have enough talent or conviction to talk about what they knew but had not seen. Therefore, neither about the Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the starving dead collected in the morning in the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degrees at Hiroshima. Hence this impression that history classes, documentaries and films later would not dispel: neither the crematories nor the atomic bomb were in the same era as black market butter, alerts and basement raids.
They segued by comparison to the previous war, the Great One, that of '14, won in blood and glory, a men's war that the women at the table listened to with respect. They talked about the Chemin des Dames and Verdun, about those gassed and about the bells on November 11th 1918. They named villages from which not a single child who went to fight had returned. They contrasted soldiers in muddy trenches with prisoners from '40 (1940), warm and sheltered for five years without even having bombs dropped on their heads. They quibbled over heroism and misfortune.
The children didn't listen and rushed to leave the table as soon as they got permission, taking advantage of the general benevolence of holiday times to engage in forbidden games, jump on the beds and swing upside down. But they remembered everything. Next to fabulous times whose episodes they would not order for a long time: the Collapse, the Exodus, the Occupation, the Landing, the Victory they found dull this unnamed period in which they were growing up. They regretted not having been born or barely born when it was necessary to set off en masse on roads and sleep on straw like gypsies. Of this unexperienced time they would keep a tenacious regret. The memory of others handed down to them a secret nostalgia for this era that they had missed by so little and hope of experiencing it someday.
The frenzy that had followed the Liberation was fading. So people only thought of going out and the world was full of desires to be satisfied on the spot. Everything that constituted the first time since the war caused a rush, bananas, national lottery tickets, fireworks. Whole neighbourhoods from grandmothers supported by their daughters to infants in prams, rushed to the carnival, the torchlight procession, Bouglione circus where they nearly got trampled in the scramble. They moved en masse praying and singing on road to welcome Our Lady of Boulogne's statue and escort it back kilometres away next day. Secular or religious every opportunity was considered good for being outside together as if they want to continue living collectively. On Sunday evenings buses returned from sea with young lads in shorts singing at top of their lungs and were climbing onto roof racks for luggage storage while dogs roamed free mating on streetships.
Family stories and social narratives are one and the same. The voices of the guests delineated the spaces of youth: the countryside and farms where, from forgotten memory, men had been put to task and girls were servants, the factory where everyone had met, mingled and married, small businesses to which the most ambitious aspired. They sketched histories without personal events other than births, weddings and mourning; lives devoid of travel apart from in a distant garrison town for regimental duty. Lives consumed by work its strain and wear along with threats posed by alcohol abuse. School was a mythic backdrop: a brief golden age under a stern God figure known as the teacher who wielded his iron ruler to rap knuckles.
From hand to hand, browned photos were passed, their backs stained by all the fingers that had held them during other meals, a blend of coffee and grease fused into an indefinable color. In the rigid and solemn newlyweds, the wedding guests lining up on several rows along a wall, one couldn't recognize either their parents or anyone else. It wasn't oneself either that one saw in the half-naked baby of indistinct gender on a cushion but someone else, a creature belonging to a silent and unreachable time.
