The winter of 1993 was the most important time for me, because my father had returned. It was the week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me. I ran all the way to the school gates, and from behind the iron bars, I could see him standing outside, smoking. He was wearing a black long coat, and the upturned collar was covering half of his face. I don't know why, but even without seeing his face clearly, I could tell that he wasn't doing well. My heart ached, and tears started to fall.
I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Deep down, I felt that she should remain in pain and sorrow, just like me, due to my father's departure. Besides, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. Perhaps that was true, but happiness had the ability to find her. After all, as a beautiful woman, she didn't have to work so hard. She didn't have to do anything—she just had to stand still.
I still remember that the winter that year was particularly long. It was already halfway through April, and the peach blossoms still hadn't bloomed. Your mood was very low due to your parents' divorce. We hadn't had any new games for a long time, so in the evenings we would just sit on the roof of the Dead Man's Tower, with nothing to do. Among the body parts scattered around the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms. We hooked them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Armed Guanyin.
My father, in fact, had no idea how to do business, but he had gone to seek refuge with a distant cousin. My grandmother had a younger sister who had gone to Beijing in her youth, and had gotten married and had children there. This cousin was her eldest son, and had always been an outcast in the family.
Just now you said that everyone has a time when they start their journey, as if their life has suddenly been put on a leash. Mine was when I was eight. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing by himself. From then on, I no longer had a home.
I had no intention of keeping the appointment. For whatever reason, I felt that there was no longer any need for us to meet. I was sitting on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, when the sky gradually darkened. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The water delivery boy was standing outside, carrying a bucket of water, saying he was delivering it to a family in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty gray woolen hat, and his expression was dazed.
Our conversation was very difficult. Every time we fell into a silence, I felt my heart being compressed, and I just wanted to end the meeting as soon as possible. You seemed to have noticed, but still kept trying to find a topic of conversation. The tea had cooled down, and the white mist in the room had dispersed. Finally, you stood up to leave. Just as I closed the door, I felt a sense of relief. But then the doorbell rang again. You were standing outside the door, asking me to come to Little White Tower later. Before I had a chance to refuse, you had already walked out of the doorway.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had already evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist. You sat down awkwardly and watched me pour the tea. "Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?" you asked. I told you that my grandmother had already passed away, and that I was now living with my aunt. "She never got married?" you asked. "No," I replied.
The white breath that came out of your mouth, the curls of your hair that were being blown by the wind, and the slight trembling of your knees beneath the hem of your coat—all of these made me believe that you were a real person, and not just a continuation of the dream I had before. It was no surprise that I couldn't recognize you after not seeing you for eighteen years. You weren't wearing any makeup, and your pale face was a little swollen, but you had still managed to live up to everyone's expectations and become a beautiful woman. Your peach-shaped face was a little gloomy, and you had the look of someone who had been in the city for a long time. You asked me if you looked different from what I had imagined. I just smiled without answering. To be honest, I had never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. Everything related to you had already been sealed away in a file folder, and the glue was dry. It might hurt to say this, but I had never expected to see you again.
I opened my eyes, and there you were, standing in the doorway. I don't know how long you had been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my dream. And the sadness of waking up, the look of my weakest moment. Cheng Gong, you called my name in a low, hoarse voice, as if you hadn't spoken in a long time. It was about to snow, and the sky was very dark. The room was pitch black. The water in the stove was boiling, bubbling and rolling. I looked at you for a while, to make sure I didn't recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing across from me was somehow deeply connected to my life. I felt a chill down my spine. I tried to remember, and the cards of memory flipped through my mind. Then you said, you were Li Jiaqi.
