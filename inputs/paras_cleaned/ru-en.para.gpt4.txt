The relentless noise of the sea didn't cease for a minute. It rolled in with long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subduing. And the wind would start rustling in the bare trees, then fall silent, just as I did while listening to the flow of night. But it wasn't going away; it was here. I knew this by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely audible tremor of a solitary sycamore leaf. I had noticed this stubborn gray leaf during daytime but now at night it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only wakeful friend. Occasionally gunshots were heard from darkness—from city's direction—then dogs would bark for long after each shot fired before falling silent again. Then from far out at sea there flickered a dim fire and faded out immediately afterwards.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, revealing many qualities in them that we had not previously noticed. In the pitted yellow stone, there were many small seashells firmly embedded within it, on the ragweed bushes a few flowers still remained, sitting on straight firm stems like soaked and shriveled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun. But it very rarely peered through the fog as a blurred white spot, providing neither heat nor shade. Underneath the single old plane tree with lemon spots on its trunk lay leaves that seemed to be cut out of dull green velvet. Ants paraded in a line through the cast-iron gate carrying supplies to their underground larders for winter while under an anchor chain lived a small timid frog.
At night on the other side of the river, someone started waving a lantern and shouting loudly. I went to the riverside with my Uncle Ilko. The river was roaring. Water rushed over the dam in a cold waterfall. The night was late and silent, not a single star above our heads. The wild freshness of the flooded waters, of thawed earth blew in our faces. And all this time someone kept waving a lantern on that far bank and shouting, but their words couldn't be made out over the noise of the river.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses unharnessed and tethered to it, and a little woman in black mother. She stood motionless on the bank. From there she watched as they carried out father. Then she dropped to her knees and fell headlong into the sand.
"No," the grandfather replied. "That's true, we didn't meet. Ostap began to go blind. He decided then to go to Petersburg in order to see that woman before he became totally blind. He reached the Tsar's capital and found out that she had died perhaps she couldn't stand the separation. Ostap found her grave on cemetery made of white marble, looked at it, and his heart failed his iron rose lay on the stone. That woman had willed for a rose to be placed on her grave forever. And Ostap started playing the lyre and probably died along the way or in a market under a cart wheel.Amen!"
On that bank, Countess Branicka's nature reserve forest was rising up the slope. The sun couldn't break through the dense greenery of this forest. Only occasionally would a solitary ray cut diagonally across the thicket and reveal to us the stunning strength of plant life. Like sparkling specks, little birds flew into this ray. They chased each other with squeaks and dove into foliage as though it was green water.
I was filling a bucket with water from the pond, adding grass to the water and waiting. Red bobbers stood motionlessly in the water. Then one of them would start to shiver, making light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim aside. My father would strike, the line got tense, walnut fishing rod bent into an arc and bubbling, splashing noise began over misty pond. Water rippled moving lily pads; whirligig beetles hastily scattered away and finally golden gleams started flickering in mysterious depths. Until my father dragged onto flattened grass a heavy crucian carp it was impossible to distinguish what it was. It laid on its side panting and flapping fins. Its scales had an amazing scent similar to that of an underwater kingdom.
Yasha was counting seconds to himself. We knew that from Sturdzovsky Lane to the Landesman sanatorium it was a seven-minute walk. Inside the sanatorium, behind a high fence and iron gates, we always felt completely safe. Especially if we did not light up the smokehouses. As we were walking by an alleyway, Yasha stumbled. Later on, when we remembered the incident in Sturdzovsky Lane, Yasha claimed that whenever you want to do something in an ideal way you're bound to mess up over trivial matters. In my mind though, I believed Yasha's unbearable gait had been at fault for everything—though I kept silent as not to upset him.
We stealthily went down the alley. I said we should walk on the side where there is an archway. Before we reach it, we should stop and listen carefully, then quickly and silently pass by the archway. My calculations seemed mathematically accurate to me. If there are people in the archway, they might not notice us at all. On the contrary, if we walk on the side opposite to the archway, they could spot us from afar. I figured that in this case, we would be moving against or more precisely visible for a longer period of time—five times longer really—to those hidden in that menacing archway thus increasing our chances of being noticed five-fold.
I woke up in the morning from the hot sun beating against the white walls. Red and yellow hibiscus swayed by the open window. Together with them, a nasturtium flower peeked into the room; a fluffy bee nested inside of it. I watched, motionless, as it irritably backed away and came out of the narrow flower. Light streaks ran endlessly across the ceiling, lightweight waves reflections of the river. The river roared right there, nearby.
