The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment. It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying and sometimes subsiding. The wind would start to rustle in the bare trees and then fall silent, just as I listened to the flow of the night. But he didn't leave, he was here. I knew this from the smell of wet pebbles and the barely audible rustle of a solitary maple leaf. I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only lively companion. Occasionally, shots from a rifle could be heard coming from the darkness of the city. After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time. Then far out at sea a dim light flickered and went out.
He would make us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before. Thus, in the yellowish-brown stone there were many small sea shells firmly embedded in it, on the bushes of broom there were still a few flowers, they sat on straight, firm stems, like wet and crumpled golden butterflies, and patiently waited for the sun. But it rarely emerged in the mist as a blurry white patch, giving neither warmth nor shade. Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, leaves were lying about as if cut out of a dull green velvet. Ants were running in a line through the iron gate, carrying away the last supplies for winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
At night on the other side of the river someone started waving a flashlight and shouting in a drawn-out voice. I went out to the shore with my uncle Ilko. The river was roaring. The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall. It was a late, silent night, and not a single star was visible in the sky. A wild freshness blew in his face, melted from the earth. And all the time someone was waving a flashlight on the other bank and shouting, but the words were lost in the noise of the river.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black the mother. She stood motionless on the shore. She saw from there how they were taking her father away. Then she knelt down and fell with her head on the sand.
No, Grandfather replied. "That's right, we haven't seen each other. Ostap started to go blind. He had the idea of travelling to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind. He arrived at the royal capital and found out that she had died perhaps she could not bear the separation. Ostap found her grave on the cemetery made of white marble, looked at it and his heart broke his iron rose was lying on the stone. That woman bequeathed to have a rose placed on her grave. Forever. And Ostap began to sing and, maybe, he died on the road or at the market under the cart. Amen!"
On the other shore, the Countess Branitskaya's reserved forest rose up the slope. The sun could not penetrate through the thick foliage of this forest. Only occasionally a solitary ray of light pierced through the thicket and revealed to us the astonishing power of vegetation. Like sparkling dust, small birds flew into this ray of light. They chased each other with a squeal and dove into the foliage, as if into green water.
I was scooping water from the pond into a bucket, throwing in some grass, and waiting. The red floats stood still in the water. Then one of them would start to flinch, let out light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away. The father was winding the line, the nut-wood rod was bending into an arc, and in the mist above the pond there was a buzzing, splashing and commotion. The water was spreading, rocking the buckets, water beetles were scurrying off in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glimmer appeared in the depths. It was impossible to tell what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp from the grass he had baited. He was lying on his side, drifting and flapping his fins. From his scales emanated an amazing smell of the underwater kingdom.
Yasha counted the seconds to himself. We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium. Behind the high fence and iron gates of the sanatorium, we always felt completely safe. Especially if they didn't light the stove.  As we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled. Then, when we remembered the incident in the Sturdzov alley, Yasha insisted that if you want to do something in the best way, you will always fail on a trifle. I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything. But I kept quiet so as not to upset Yasha.
We crept along the alley. I said that we should go on the other side of the gateway, not reaching it, stop and listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass by the gateway. I believe the calculation was mathematically accurate. If there are people in the alleyway, they may not even notice us. If we go in the opposite direction from the alley, we can be seen from a distance. I calculated that in the last case we would be going against a dangerous alleyway, or rather, we would be visible to the people hiding in the alleyway for five times longer. Therefore, there will be five times more chances for us to be noticed.
In the morning I would wake up from the hot sun beating against the white walls. Red and yellow pansies swayed outside the open window. Along with them, a nasturtium flower peeked into the room. a furry bee was sitting in it. I stood still, watching as she angrily wriggled and freed herself from the tight flower. Streams of light ran endlessly across the ceiling, gentle waves reflections of the river. The river was roaring nearby.
