Two other small, serrated photos, likely from the same year, show the same child, but younger, in a ruffled dress with puffed sleeves. On the first floor, she nestled playfully against a large-built woman wearing a bold striped dress, her hair pulled back into a high bun. On the other hand, she raises her left fist, while her right hand is held by a tall man wearing a light-colored jacket and pants, with a casual posture. The two photos were taken on the same day in front of a wall topped with a border of flowers, in a paved courtyard. Over the heads, a clothesline passes, on which a pin has gotten stuck.
Another photo, signed by the same photographer but with a more ordinary paper and lacking the golden border, doubtless intended for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of around four years old, serious, almost sad despite a lively face framed by short hair, parted in the middle and pulled back by barrettes adorned with ribbons, like butterflies. The left hand rests on the same carved table, entirely visible, in the Louis XVI style. She appears strait-laced in her corset, her sleeveless dress riding up in front due to a prominent belly, perhaps a sign of rickets (1944, approximately).
The boys were proud to leave for the regiment and they were found handsome in their soldier's uniforms. On the evening of the review board, they went on a tour of the cafes to celebrate being recognized as real men. Before the regiment, they were still just kids and weren't worth anything on the job or marriage market. Afterward, they could have a wife and children. The uniforms they wore during their leaves in the neighborhood were steeped in patriotic beauty and virtual sacrifice. The shadow of the victorious fighters, the GIs, hovered around them. The rough fabric of the smock, brushed against when we stood on tiptoes to kiss them, materialized the absolute cut between the universe of men and that of women. Seeing them, one felt a sense of heroism.
Under the immobility, the posters of last year's circus with Roger Lanzac's photo, the first communion pictures distributed to friends, the Songwriters' Club on Radio Luxembourg, the days filled with new desires. On Sunday afternoons, we would crowd around the window of the electronics store in front of the TV. Cafes were investing in the purchase of a station to attract customers. Along the hillsides, dirt bike trails snaked around, and all day long, the deafening machines climbed and descended. The growing impatience of commerce with its new buzzwords, "initiative," "dynamism," was shaking the routine of the cities. Between the funfair and the kermesse, the Quinzaine commerciale established itself as a springtime ritual. In the streets of the city center, loudspeakers blared invitations to buy, interspersed with songs by Annie Cordy and Eddie Constantine, to win a Simca or a dining room set. On the podium, at the town hall square, a local animator was making people laugh with jokes by Roger Nicolas and Jean Richard, and was calling out candidates for the "Crochet or Quit" game, just like on the radio. Seated in a corner of the stage, the Queen of Commerce sat under her crown. The merchandise was advancing under the colors of the festival. People were saying "things are changing" or "we can't get stuck, we'll go crazy staying at home."
But they only talked about what they had seen, which could be relived through eating and drinking. They did not have enough talent or conviction to speak about what they knew but had not seen. Therefore, no Jewish children boarding trains to Auschwitz, no dead bodies collected in the morning in the Warsaw Ghetto, no 10,000 degrees in Hiroshima. "From where did this impression come that history classes, documentaries, and films would not dispel later: neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb were in the same era as black market butter, alerts, and trips to the cellar."
They were comparing the current war to the Great War, the one in 14, which was won, they said, in blood and glory, a man's war that the women at the table listened to with respect. They were talking about the Chemin des Dames and Verdun, the gassed soldiers, and the bells of November 11, 1918. They named villages where not a single child who had left for the front had returned. They opposed the soldiers in the mud of the trenches to the prisoners of 40, who were warm and sheltered for five years, without even receiving bombs on their heads. They were disputing heroism and misfortune.
The children didn't listen and quickly left the table as soon as they were given permission, taking advantage of the general goodwill of the holidays to engage in forbidden games, jumping on the beds and doing handstands. But they kept everything. Beside the fabulous time that they would not organize for a long time, the Debacle, the Exodus, the Occupation, the Landing, the Victory, they found the one without a name, where they grew up, dull. They regretted not being born, or barely, when it was time to set out in droves on the roads and sleep on straw like gypsies. They would keep a persistent regret for that unlived time. The memory of others reminded them of a secret nostalgia for a time they had missed by so little, and the hope of living it one day.
The frenzy that had followed the Liberation was subsiding. Then people only thought about going out and the world was full of desires to be satisfied immediately. Or, in a more idiomatic English translation:People were only interested in going out and the world was full of instant gratification. Everything that constituted the first time since the war was causing a rush, the bananas, the National Lottery tickets, the fireworks. By whole neighborhoods, from the grandmother supported by her daughters to the baby in a pram, people rushed to the funfair, to the torchlight procession, to the Bouglione Circus where they nearly got trampled in the crush. They thronged the road in prayer and song to welcome the statue of Our Lady of Boulogne and escort it back the next day over several kilometers. Profane or religious, every occasion was good for them to be outdoors together, as if they wanted to continue living collectively. On Sunday evening, the cars returned from the sea with tall young men in shorts singing at the top of their lungs, perched on the roof racks. The dogs were walking freely and mating in the middle of the street.
Family story and social story, it's all one. The voices of the guests defined the spaces of youth: the countryside and the farms where, for as long as anyone could remember, men had been hired hands and women had been servants, the factory where everyone had met, socialized, and married, and the small businesses where the most ambitious had risen through the ranks. They drew stories without personal events other than births, marriages, and deaths, without travels beyond the regiment in a distant garrison town, lives occupied by work, its hardship and wear, and the threats of alcohol. The school was a mythical backdrop, a brief golden age when the Teacher was the harsh god with his iron rule for rapping on fingers.
From hand to hand, photos with brown edges passed, stained on the back by all the fingers that had held them during other meals, a mix of coffee and grease melted into an indeterminable color. In the stiff and formal wedding, the guests seated in rows along a wall, no one recognized their parents or anyone else. It wasn't me that one saw in the half-naked baby of indeterminate sex on a cushion, but someone else, a creature belonging to a silent and inaccessible time.
