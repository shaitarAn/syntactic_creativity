She looks at the family, all girls, a mother with a child at her breast is just clumsily descending from the cart and the carter hurries her because the cart has to go back for others in the suburbs. A knapsack that she had on her back falls off and spills out some grayed out rags and a single string of beads, small, darkened. The woman collects them embarrassed as if she had just revealed her most inaccessible secrets to the world. Lady Deym passes by her and suddenly a little boy runs up to her, maybe six or seven years old, and looking at her with smiling eyes very satisfied with himself he says "Praised be Jesus Christ!". She responds automatically but also solemnly: "Forever and ever amen". And she grabs into her heart straight away as tears rush to her eyes. She kneels down next to him grabbing his wrists while he still looks into his eyes full of tears smiling like a cheeky little boy.
The first buildings spring up before them suddenly, without warning. It seems that the fog alters their perception of distance, as even Kaśka herself appears surprised by this. She suddenly jumps, jerking at the shafts; and if it wasn't for Roszek's firm response and his whip, she would have tipped over the cart. Perhaps Kaśka was startled by the sparks flying from the forge, or by the unease of horses waiting their turn to be shod...
Everywhere you can smell the cloying scent of malt, it permeates every good that is on sale. You could fill up on it like bread. In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babintsy, there are a few small breweries from where this fulfilling aroma spreads throughout the nearby areas. Many stalls sell beer here, while better stores stock both spirits and mead - mainly trojniak. The shop run by Jewish merchant Wakszul offers wine, real Hungarian and Rhine wine, as well as a slightly sour kind brought all the way from Wallachia.
There would be a lot to say about the Wołowski family, as it has grown to enormous size. Almost all branches of this family were ennobled, some had the Bawół coat of arms, others had the Na kaskach coat of arms. Undoubtedly, Franciszek - the son of Isaac Wołowski (the same one whom Father Chmielowski named Jeremiah) - had an outstanding career. Born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, he became one of the best lawyers and legal scholars at that time. Interestingly enough – when a proposal for granting Polish citizenship to Jews was raised at parliament, Franciszek as MP gave an impassioned speech arguing that it wasn't yet time for such a step. First, Poles needed to fight for their independence and only then would there be time for social reforms.
All the neophytes from Offenbach were buried in the city cemetery, which after many years began to interfere with the city's expansion plans and was abolished in 1866. The remains of those buried there were collected and respectfully reinterred elsewhere. On this occasion, the skull of Jakub Frank was removed from its grave and, carefully labeled as "the skull of a Jewish patriarch", it found its way into the hands of an Offenbach historian. Many years later, under unknown circumstances, it ended up in Berlin where it underwent detailed measurements and examinations and was deemed an example of racial inferiority among Jews. After the war, all traces of it were lost - perhaps destroyed in wartime upheavals, dissolved into dust or still lying somewhere in underground warehouses of a museum.
After Jakub's death, a time of great peace began for me. My main occupation became the study of the merkavah, to which our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski were added, as we lived in one room and thus got closer to each other. To him, Jeruchim, I also told about Chai Szor - that she was the only woman I could love and loved from that beautiful moment when I got her for one night when I arrived with news about Jakub in Rohatyn. But above all else, I loved Jakub.
They had been in Ivany since April. If it wasn't for the kind Ivanians, they probably would have starved to death. Ivany saved their lives and health, Bejla now feels better and she no longer coughs so much. Srol believes that once they are baptized, they will be as well off as Christians. They will get a piece of land, Bejlja will have vegetables in the garden, and he, Srol, will weave kilims because he is good at it. In old age when their daughters are married off, they will take them in. These are all his dreams.
"Look, benefactor, Kaśka doesn't want to move," says Roszko gloomily when the carriage stops. Roszko gets down from the buckboard and waves his hand in farewell several times with great force. Then he leans over and peers into the fog as if looking into water. Underneath his festive red coat, which has already faded somewhat, a shirt pops out. "I don't know where to go," he says. "What do you mean you don't know? We're already on the Rohatyn road," says an astonished priest. Yet they are! He gets out of the carriage and follows his servant, helplessly circling around it while squinting hard into the white haze around them. They seem to see something but their eyes start playing tricks on them when they cannot set focus on anything concrete anymore - what a ridiculous situation! It's like getting lost in your own pocket. Suddenly, "Hush!" says Father while lifting his finger upwards in order to listen more intently to something only he can hear . And indeed there is some noise coming somewhere from the left side within clumps of fog - it's a weak sound of running water. "Let us follow that noise then; it must be water flowing," decides Father.
Soon the priest relaxes in the coach, stretches his legs out front and lets his eyes wander over the sea of fog. He immediately falls into a travel reverie because movement is when a person thinks best. Slowly, hesitantly, the mechanism of his mind comes to life – gears and cogs surprise him by setting other wheels in motion, just like in the clock that stands on his parish hallway,. He bought it in Lviv and paid dearly for it. Soon there will be a chime of bells. The world might have come from such fog, he begins to ponder. After all, the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius asserts that the world was created during fall equinoxes. It's plausible since there were fruits in paradise; if an apple hung on a tree, then it must've been autumn... There's some logic to this thinking. But another thought quickly occurs: What weak argument is this? Could not an omnipotent God create such mundane fruits extra at any time of year?
When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join a stream of pedestrians, riders and carriages of all kinds emerging from the fog, like little bread figures molded for Christmas. It's Wednesday, market day in Rohatyn. Peasant carts laden with sacks of grain, cages with poultry and various farm produce are headed there. Among them stride briskly traders carrying every kind of possible ware – their stalls ingeniously folded up now and carried on their backs like a yoke – that will soon become tables full of colorful materials, wooden toys or eggs bought cheaply throughout the villages... The farmers also lead goats and cows for sale - animals terrified by the noise are stuck in puddles. They're being passed by a speeding cart covered with a tattered tarpaulin full of rowdy Jews who flock to Rohatyn's fair from all around; behind them is pushing through a rich carriage which struggles to maintain its dignity in this misty crowd on the road - its light shiny doors are black from mud while expression on face coachman wearing blue cloak seems turned sour– he evidently didn't expect such turmoil and now desperately scans for an opportunity to escape this devilish road.
