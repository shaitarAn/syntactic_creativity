She looks at the family, all girls, a mother with a child at her breast just clumsily gets off the cart and the carter urges her on, because the cart has to go back for others in the suburbs. A bundle falls from her back and spills out some grayish rags and a single string of beads, small, darkened. The woman collects them ashamedly as if she had just revealed her most inaccessible secrets to the world. Deymowa passes her by and suddenly a boy runs up to her, maybe six or seven years old, looking at her with pleased eyes, very satisfied with himself saying: "Praise be Jesus Christ!". She replies automatically but also charmingly: "For ever and ever amen". And already she clutches at heart and tears pool in her eyes. She squats next to the boy grabs his wrists while he looks straight into tears filled eyes still smiling this little rascal.
The first buildings emerge before them, suddenly, without warning. The mist changes the feeling of distance, and Kaśka seems surprised by it herself. Suddenly, she jumps, startled, and if it weren't for Roszek's quick reaction and his bat, she would have overturned the carriage. Maybe the sparks flying from the forge frightened Kaśka, or the restlessness of the horses waiting their turn to be shod...
Everywhere you can smell the sweet aroma of malt, permeating every item for sale. You can eat it like bread. In the suburbs of Rohatyn and Babinychi, there are several small breweries, from where this intoxicating aroma spreads throughout the area. Many shops sell beer, but better stores have a supply of vodka, honey, and mead, mainly trójniak. The Jewish merchant Wakszul's warehouse offers wine, genuine Hungarian and genuine Rhine wine, and some slightly sour wine that they bring here all the way from Wallachia.
The most would be said about the Wołowski family, as it has grown to immense proportions. Almost all branches of this clan were ennobled, some bearing the Bawół coat of arms, others the Na Kaskach. Undoubtedly, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wołowski, made a great career for himself. The same Franciszek whom Father Chmielowski called Jeremiasz. Born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, he became one of the best lawyers and legal experts of his time. Interestingly, when a motion was brought before the Sejm to grant Polish citizenship to Jews, Franciszek, as a member of parliament, delivered a passionate speech in which he argued that it was not yet time for such a step. First, the Polish nation must win its independence, and only then will it be time for social reforms.
All the Offenbach neophytes were buried in the municipal cemetery, which, however, began to hinder the city's development plans and was liquidated in 1866. The remains of the people buried there were collected and reburied with respect in another location. On this occasion, the skull of Jacob Frank was removed from the grave and, described carefully as "the skull of a Jewish patriarch," found its way into the hands of a local historian. Many years later, under unknown circumstances, it ended up in Berlin, where it was subjected to detailed measurements and studies and was identified as an example of Jewish racial inferiority. After the war, it disappeared without a trace - perhaps destroyed by the chaos of war, scattered to dust, or still lying in the depths of some museum's storage rooms.
After Jakub's death, a time of great peace settled over me. My main occupation became studying the Torah, and our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, who lived in the same room as me, brought us closer together. I also told him about Chai Szor - the only woman I could have loved and did love from that beautiful moment when I spent a night with her, when I arrived in Rohatyn with news of Jakub's death. But above all, I loved Jakub.
They were in Ivany from April. If it weren't for the kind people of Ivany, they would have probably died of hunger. Ivany saved their lives and health, Bejla feels better now and doesn't cough as much. Srol believes that when they get baptized, things will be just as good for them as for Christians. They'll get a piece of land, Bejla will have vegetables in the garden, and Srol will weave carpets, which he does well. In old age, when they give their daughters away in marriage, they'll take them in. That's all his dreams.
"Look, good sir, Kaśka doesn't want to go - says Roszko with a gloomy face, as the carriage stops. Roszko gets off the horse and says goodbye a few times, rubbing his eyes vigorously. Then he leans down and looks into the fog, as if he's staring into the water. From under his worn, red cap, although a bit faded, a shirt peeks out. - I don't know where to go - he says. - How do you not know? We're already on the Rogaty highway - says the surprised priest. And yet! He gets off the carriage and follows the servant, wandering aimlessly around their carriage while straining their eyes in white. They think they see something but their eyes are playing tricks on them since they can’t focus on anything specific. Something like this happening to them is akin to losing oneself in one’s own pocket! "Quiet!" suddenly commands the priest raising his finger upwards while intently listening for something unheard by others.Surely enough from somewhere on their left side through clumps of fog reaches them faint murmur of water.“Let's follow that sound.`It’s flowing water.” decides priest."
The priest soon relaxes in his hammock, stretching out his legs and allowing his gaze to wander over the sea of mist. He immediately becomes lost in thought, as he finds it easier to think while in motion. The mechanism of his mind begins to work freely, surprising him with its associations and connections, like the gears of a clock, which he has in his study at the rectory, bought in Lviv; he paid a pretty penny for it. After a moment, the sound of a bell breaks the silence. Perhaps the world didn't arise from such mist, he begins to ponder. Jewish historian Josephus Flavius argues that the world was created in the fall, during the autumnal equinox. It's not hard to see why; after all, there were fruits in paradise. If an apple hung on a tree, it must have been fall... There's some logic to that. But then another thought occurs to him: What kind of argument is this? Couldn't an all-powerful God have created such unnecessary fruits at any time of year?
When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join the stream of pedestrians, horses, and carts of all kinds emerging from the mist, like Christmas decorations made of bread. It's Wednesday, market day in Rohatyn, and peasant carts loaded with grain, poultry, and various agricultural products are on their way. Between them, vendors carrying all sorts of goods march briskly - their stands now cleverly folded up can be carried on backs like loads on a stick. They will soon become tables loaded with colourful fabric materials; wooden toys; eggs purchased from villages at one-fourth the city price... The peasants also lead goats and cows to be sold – animals frightened by the noise stubbornly stand in puddles. A recklessly fast wagon covered in patched tarpaulin overtakes them; it is full of noisy Jews who come to the fair in Rohatyn from everywhere. Immediately behind them struggles a wealthy carriage which is having trouble maintaining its dignity amidst this commotion – its shiny varnished doors are muddied black while the slightly slack face of footman wrapped in blue cloak hints at unexpected bewilderment as he appears overwhelmed by such chaos while desperately looking for an opportunity to deviate away from this hellish road.
