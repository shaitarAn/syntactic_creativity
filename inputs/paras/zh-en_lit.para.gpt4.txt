In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my father returned, just a week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me. I ran all the way to the gate and saw him standing outside smoking through the iron fence from a distance. He was wearing a black long trench coat with his collar up hiding half his face. I didn't know why, even though I couldn't see his face clearly, but it seemed as if he wasn't doing very well. My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.
I never thought that my mother would consider remarriage. Maybe subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer over my father's departure, just like me. Moreover, I felt she didn't have the ability to find happiness again. This might actually be true, but perhaps happiness has the ability to find her instead. Isn't it? As a beautiful woman, she doesn't have to work so hard; she doesn't need to do anything but stand still.
I still remember, that year winter was particularly long, it was already mid-April, but the winter jasmine flowers had not yet bloomed. Your parents' divorce dampened your mood a lot. We hadn't had any new games for a long time and at dusk we would sit idly on top of the tower in the cemetery. Among those scattered body parts in the yard, a few more arms were added. We used hooks to pull them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin statue.
In fact, my father knows nothing about doing business, he just went to join a cousin who he wasn't very familiar with. My grandmother had a sister who moved to Beijing when she was young and later got married and had children there. This cousin is her eldest son, and has always been seen as an odd one out in the entire family.
You just said that everyone has a time when their fate starts to take hold, as if life is suddenly reined in. It seems mine started at eight years old. That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. After that, I no longer had a home.
I have no intention of keeping the appointment. No matter the reason, I don't think we need to see each other again. I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, as it grew darker and darker outside, there came a sudden knock at the door. The boy who delivers water was standing at my door front with a bucket in tow, saying he had to deliver water to a family in West Suburb. He was wearing a dirty grey woolen hat and looked dazed.
Our conversation was tough. Each time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being oppressed and just wanted to end this meeting quickly. You seemed to notice something but were still trying hard to find a topic of conversation. As the tea got cold, the white fog in the room had dissipated, and you finally stood up to leave. Right after I closed the door and breathed a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again. You were standing at the doorway asking me to come over to Xiaobai Building later on. Before I had a chance to refuse, you'd already left through the building's entrance.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist. You sat down uncomfortably, watching me pour tea. "Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?" You asked. I told you that my grandmother has passed away, and I now live with my aunt. "So she never got married?" You asked again. "Yes," I answered.
The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, the slightly trembling knees under your coat hemline, all these make me believe that you standing before me are really there and not an extension of a dream I had before. It's been eighteen years since we last saw each other; it's no surprise I don't recognize you. You are without makeup−a pale face and slightly swollen, but at least you didn't disappoint everyone's expectations and grew into a beautiful woman. It’s just that heart-shaped little face of yours looks gloomy as if stayed for too long in a big city. You asked me if your appearance is different than what I imagined. I just responded with an ambiguous smile. Honestly speaking, I've never imagined how would look like grown up . To me, everything related to you has already been put in file bags and sealed with wax seal; sad to say perhaps but it might hurt—I really didn’t expect to meet you again.
I opened my eyes. You were standing at the door. I don't know how long you had been there, you might even have seen me laughing in my dream. And the sadness when I woke up, and how I looked at my weakest moment. Cheng Gong, you softly called my name, your voice was very hoarse, as if you haven't spoken for a long time. It was about to snow; it was severely overcast and dark inside the room. The water on the stove boiled and rolled with gurgling sounds. I looked at you carefully for a while, sure that I didn't recognize you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing across from me seemed deeply connected to my life—a feeling that sent chills down my spine—I tried hard to think back while memory cards fluttered in my mind then  you said "You are Li Jia Qi".
