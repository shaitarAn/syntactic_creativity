Mihoko and Satsuki often meet up in their hometown, and they have similar facial expressions and ways of speaking. Especially when eating sweets, they both have the habit of breaking off small pieces with their hands, which have been manicured with nail polish, and bringing them to their mouths. It seems like they've done this before, but I can't quite remember. The small habits and mannerisms they displayed when we last met have probably flowed away to somewhere else.
Miho has recently married and bought a used house in the countryside, where she often hosts gatherings with friends. Although she sometimes feels pressured to conform to societal expectations, she values the unique opportunity to interact with other women in their thirties who are not part of her usual convenience store circle. Therefore, she tries to participate in Miho's invitations as much as possible. Today, along with Miho, Yukari, who is still raising a young child, and Satsuki, who is married but childless, the three of us gathered at Miho's house with cake and tea.
At that time, I became a part of the world for the first time. I was born as a normal part of the world, and that day, I certainly came into being.
For two weeks until the opening, we practiced as a pair, playing the roles of customers and store employees, and taking turns being the cashier. We learned how to handle various situations, such as greeting customers with a smile, putting merchandise in paper bags, separating hot and cold items, and disinfecting our hands with alcohol before handling food. We also got used to handling real money, but the register had a sign that read "Training" in big letters, and our opponents were our part-time job colleagues wearing the same uniforms, pretending to be customers.
My two-year-old sister was not like me, she was a normal child, and she didn't avoid me because I was different. Instead, she admired me and would often come near me. When our mother scolded her for doing something ordinary, I would approach her and ask, "Why are you angry?" Because I asked Mother, she would finish her lecture and, feeling a bit embarrassed, my sister would always say "thank you" to me. I didn't have much interest in sweets or toys, so I often gave them to my sister. That's why she always stuck by me.
"Dad, I love grilled chicken, so let's grill this and eat it today," I said, repeating the words clearly. Mother seemed surprised; her eyes, nostrils and mouth all opened wide in shock. The other mother next to us also seemed startled; she was making such a funny face that I felt like laughing. Looking at my hand, I thought to myself that one bird wouldn't be enough. "Should we get more?" When I glanced at two or three sparrows walking nearby, my mom finally snapped back to reality and shouted desperately at me: "Keiko!" Look sadly around you â€“ your friends are crying. They must have been lonely because their friend died." "But why?" Despite the fact that they're already dead," My question left my mom speechless.
He quickly put the canned coffee, cigarettes, and American dogs into a large paper bag. Meanwhile, the man who had been rummaging through his pockets seemed to have had an idea and reached into his chest pocket. Judging from his gesture, it seemed that he was going to pay with electronic money.
"Welcome, good morning!" With a light nod, I receive the canned coffee that the male customer has offered. "Ah, I'll also take number five cigarette." "Understood." Quickly pulling out a Marlboro Light Menthol and scanning it at the register. "Please touch for age verification." While touching the screen, noticing that when seeing his gaze smoothly shifting to the showcase lined with fast food, stopping finger movements. Thinking of saying "Will you have something?", but when it seems like he is deliberating whether or not to buy it from customers, they decided to step back and wait.
The man's eyes reacted to the faint sound of small change and turned towards the register. Many people who rustle through their pockets or purse for coins are likely to be buying cigarettes or a newspaper before quickly leaving, so he was sensitive to the sound of money. As a result, he approached the register with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand thrust into his pocket, ready to pay. He quickly moved through the store and took a position near the register, standing tall and waiting for his turn without bothering the other customers.
The convenience store is filled with sound. The chime of the doorbell as customers come in, the voice of the idol advertising new products over the in-store broadcast, the beeping of the barcode scanner, the sound of items being placed in a bag, the crinkling of a bag of chips, the sound of high heels walking around the store. Everything blends together to create the "convenience store sound" that constantly stimulates my eardrums.
