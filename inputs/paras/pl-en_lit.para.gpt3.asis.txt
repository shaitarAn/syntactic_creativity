He watches a family, all girls, as the mother with a child at her breast clumsily gets off the cart and the driver hurries her, for the cart has to go back to the suburbs to pick up others. A bundle she had on her back falls and a few faded rags and a single string of beads, small and darkened, spill out of it. The woman hastily gathers them, as if she had just exposed her most intimate secrets to the world. Deym passes her and suddenly a boy, maybe six or seven years old, runs up to her and looking at her with a smiling face, very pleased with himself, says: “Blessed be Jesus Christ!” She automatically, but solemnly, responds: “For ever and ever, amen.” And she clutches her heart and tears fill her eyes. She kneels by the boy, grabs him by the wrists, and he looks at her with his eyes full of tears, still smiling, a little rascal.
The first buildings start to appear before them, suddenly, without warning. The fog seems to distort the sense of distance, for Kasia seems taken aback by it. Suddenly she jumps, tugging at the reins, and if it weren’t for Roszek’s firm reaction and his whip, she would have overturned the carriage. Perhaps Kasia was scared by the sparks flying from the fire, or the unease of the horses waiting their turn to be shod. . .
The faint smell of malt pervades everything for sale. You could eat it like bread. In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babińce, there are a few small breweries, from which the nourishing aroma spreads across the whole area. Many stalls sell beer here, and the better shops have both moonshine and mead in stock, mainly three-grain. The Jewish merchant Wakszul’s store offers wine, real Hungarian and real Rhine, and some slightly sour stuff they bring all the way from Transylvania.
The most to be said would be about the Wołowski family, as it had grown to immense proportions. Almost all the branches of this family had been ennobled, one with the Bawół coat of arms, the other with the Na Kaskach coat of arms. Undoubtedly, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wołowski, the same one whom Father Chmielowski had called Jeremiah, had made a great career. He was born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, and became one of the best lawyers and legal experts of the time. Interestingly, when the motion to grant Polish citizenship to Jews was presented to the Sejm, Franciszek, as a member of parliament, argued in his passionate speech that it was not yet the time for such a step. First the Polish nation must win its independence, and then it will be time for social reforms.
All of the Offenbach neophytes were buried in the city cemetery, which however began to interfere with the city’s expansion plans and was closed down in 1866. The bones of those buried there were collected and respectfully reinterred elsewhere. At this occasion the skull of Jacob Frank was removed from the grave and, carefully described as “the skull of a Jewish patriarch”, ended up in the hands of an Offenbach historian. Many years later, in unknown circumstances, it arrived in Berlin, where it was subjected to detailed measurements and tests and declared to be an example of Jewish racial inferiority. After the war it disappeared without a trace – perhaps destroyed in the war chaos, turned to dust, or still lying in the underground storage of some museum.
After Jakub’s death, I experienced a time of great peace. My main occupation became studying the merkava, to which were added our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, since we were living in the same room, which brought us closer together. I also told him about Chai Szor – that she was the only woman I could love and I had loved her since that beautiful moment when I got her for one night, when I had come to Rohatyn with news of Jakub. But above all, I had loved Jakub.
They had been in Iwan since April. If it hadn’t been for the kind people of Iwan, they would have probably perished from hunger. Iwan had saved their lives and health, Bejla felt better now and didn’t cough as much. Srol believed that once they were baptized, they would be as well off as the Christians. They would get a piece of land, Bejla would have vegetables in her garden, and he, Srol, would weave kilims, because he was good at that. When they got old and their daughters were married off, they would take them in. Those were all his dreams.
“Look, sir, Kaska doesn’t want to go,” Roszko said gloomily as the carriage stopped. Roszko got down from the cart and made a few grand farewells. Then he bent down and peered into the fog, as if looking into water. From beneath his festive red, though somewhat faded, kubrak emerged a shirt. “I don’t know where to go,” he said. “What do you mean you don’t know? We’re already on the Rohatyn road,” the priest said, surprised. And yet! He got out of the carriage and followed the servant, walking around the carriage helplessly, straining their eyes in the whiteness. They thought they could make out something, but their eyes, unable to latch onto anything, began to play tricks on them. How could something like this have happened to them! It was as if they’d gotten lost in their own pocket. “Shh!” the priest suddenly said, raising his finger and listening. And indeed, from somewhere to the left, from the clouds of fog, came a faint sound of water. “Let’s follow this sound. It’s water running,” the priest decided.
Before long the priest relaxes into the rocking chair, stretching out his legs and letting his eyes wander over the sea of fog. He immediately falls into a travel-induced reverie, for it is in motion that man’s thoughts best take shape. Slowly, hesitantly, the mechanism of his mind springs to life, surprising gears and cogs set in motion, like the clock in his presbytery hallway, purchased in Lviv, for which he had paid dearly. Any moment now it will chime bim-bam. He starts to wonder if the world hadn’t come from such a fog. After all, the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius maintains that the world was created in the autumn, during the autumn equinox. It’s possible, for in the Garden of Eden there were fruits; if the apple was hanging from the tree, it must have been autumn. . . There’s something to it. But then another thought comes to him: What kind of argument is that? Couldn’t the all-powerful God have created extra-special fruits at any time of year?
As they approach the main road leading to Rohatyna, they join the stream of pedestrians, horse riders and all kinds of carts emerging from the mist, like figures made of bread dough for Christmas. It’s Wednesday, market day in Rohatyna, and peasant carts are rolling by, loaded with sacks of grain, cages of poultry, and all sorts of farm produce. Among them march briskly the peddlers with all kinds of merchandise – their stalls, cleverly folded now, can be carried on their backs like a knapsack, and in a moment they’ll become tables full of colorful fabrics, wooden toys, eggs bought from the villages at a quarter of the price. . . The peasants also bring goats and cows for sale – the animals, terrified by the commotion, stumble in the puddles. A rickety cart covered with a tattered tarp passes them, full of noisy Jews who come to the Rohatyna market from all around, and behind it struggles a luxurious carriage, which in the fog and the throng on the road is hard to keep dignified – its bright lacquered doors are black with mud, and the face of the coachman in the blue cloak looks dazed, he hadn’t expected such a commotion and now he’s desperately searching for an opportunity to get off this devilish road.
