{"translation": "Miho and Satsuki often meet locally, which is why they have similar facial expressions and ways of speaking."}
{"translation": "Especially the way they eat sweets is similar, and both of them are bringing the cookies to their mouths with their hands treated with nail art, breaking them into small pieces."}
{"translation": "It seems like it's been that way from the beginning, but I can't quite remember."}
{"translation": "The small habits and mannerisms of the two people I met before may have flowed away somewhere else, or so I think."}
{"translation": "Miho has married and bought a used single-family home in the countryside, where her friends often gather."}
{"translation": "\"I sometimes feel frustrated when I have to work part-time jobs tomorrow, but I consider it a valuable opportunity to interact with people outside of convenience stores and to spend time with Miho, a woman in her thirties who is not an acquaintance, and to accept her invitation."}
{"translation": "Today, Yuka and I, along with our small child, are married but the child is still Satsuki, and we are members of the family, and we are having tea at Miho's house with a cake that we brought."}
{"translation": "At that time, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time."}
{"translation": "I think I was born now."}
{"translation": "I, a normal part of the world, was certainly born on this day."}
{"translation": "For two weeks until the opening, we practiced as a two-person team, facing off against each other as if we were fictional customers."}
{"translation": "\"Looking into the customer's eyes and smiling, putting sanitary products in paper bags, separating hot and cold items, and disinfecting hands with alcohol when handling fast food."}
{"translation": "The cash register contained real money, but the receipt had the word \"TRAINING\" printed in large characters, and the person opposite me was wearing the same uniform as me, and it seemed like they were pretending to be a customer."}
{"translation": "Two years younger than me, my sister was a normal child, not like me, and she didn't avoid me, but rather admired me."}
{"translation": "My sister and I were treated differently by our mother, and when she scolded me, I approached her and asked, \"Why are you angry with me?\""}
{"translation": "My sister always said \"thank you\" to me, as if she was grateful, whenever I asked my mother a question and got scolded."}
{"translation": "I, who had little interest in sweets or toys, often gave them to my younger sister."}
{"translation": "Therefore, my sister was always clinging to me."}
{"translation": "\"Dad, I love grilled chicken, so let's grill this and eat it today,\" she said, repeating the phrase with a clear and strong pronunciation, causing her mother to shudder and the other mothers nearby to be surprised, with their eyes, noses, and mouths opening wide in unison."}
{"translation": "He had a strange look on his face, so I thought he might be laughing at me, but then I saw that he was staring at my hand, and I thought, \"Ah, that's not enough."}
{"translation": "\"Should we get more?\""}
{"translation": "When I glanced at the sparrows walking side by side nearby, my mother who had finally come to her senses scolded in a voice resembling \"Keiko!\" and cried out desperately."}
{"translation": "\"Let's build a grave for Mr. Small Bird and bury him."}
{"translation": "Hey, everyone's crying too."}
{"translation": "My friends died and it's lonely."}
{"translation": "\"Hey, isn't it pitiful?\""}
{"translation": "\"Why? Despite being already dead."}
{"translation": "My mother was speechless at my question."}
{"translation": "\"Put the canned coffee, cigarettes, and American dogs into a small S-size bag quickly."}
{"translation": "During that time, the man who had been jingling the coins in his pocket reached into his chest pocket as if he had suddenly thought of something."}
{"translation": "\"Based on his attitude, I assumed he would pay using electronic money."}
{"translation": "\"Good morning!"}
{"translation": "Here's your coffee, sir."}
{"translation": "Ah, I'll have a pack of Marlboro Lights, please."}
{"translation": "\"I'll need to verify your age."}
{"translation": "While touching the screen, seeing the man's gaze quickly move to the showcase lined with fast food, he stops moving his finger."}
{"translation": "\"When a customer asks 'Can I have something to eat? and looks undecided, I take a step back and wait for them to make a decision."}
{"translation": "Charli, with a subtle sound of small change, turns her head towards the cash register."}
{"translation": "People who rustle their fingers in their pockets or palms for small change are often those who are about to buy cigarettes or newspapers and return home, so they are sensitive to the sound of money."}
{"translation": "A man was standing near the register, holding a can of coffee in one hand and had his other hand thrust into his pocket."}
{"translation": "Quickly move inside the store, slide your body into the space behind the register counter, and wait inside without letting the customer notice."}
{"translation": "The convenience store is filled with sound."}
{"translation": "The voice of an idol promoting new products over the in-store broadcasting system as the sound of customers entering the store echoes."}
{"translation": "\"The sound of the cashier's voice announcing the price and the beep of the barcode scanner."}
{"translation": "The sound of putting things in a bag, the sound of a bread bag being squeezed, the sound of high heels walking around inside the store."}
{"translation": "Everything merges together, becoming the \"convenience store sound,\" constantly touching my eardrums."}
