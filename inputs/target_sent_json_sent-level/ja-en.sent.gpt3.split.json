{"translation": "Miho and Satsuki have similar expressions and ways of speaking, probably because they meet frequently in their hometown."}
{"translation": "In particular, the way they ate the sweets was similar; both of them broke the cookies into small pieces with their manicured hands and brought them to their mouths."}
{"translation": "I tried to think if it had been like that before, but my memory was vague."}
{"translation": "I sometimes wonder if the little habits and gestures we had when we last met have already gone somewhere else."}
{"translation": "Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family house in her hometown, where her friends often gather."}
{"translation": "I sometimes feel overwhelmed since I have to work part-time tomorrow as well, but it is the only contact I have with the world outside of the convenience store, and a valuable opportunity to interact with \"ordinary thirty-something women\" of my age, so I try to accept Miho's invitations as much as possible."}
{"translation": "Today, the members of our group were Miho, Yukari who had brought her still small child, Satsuki who was married but had no children yet, and me."}
{"translation": "We brought a cake to Miho's house and had tea."}
{"translation": "At that moment, I realized for the first time that I could be part of the world."}
{"translation": "At that moment, I felt as if I had been born."}
{"translation": "On this day I was born as a normal part of the world."}
{"translation": "For two weeks leading up to the opening, we practiced relentlessly with each other and with the staff, as if we were facing imaginary customers."}
{"translation": "Smiling and bowing when making eye contact with customers, putting sanitary products in paper bags, separating hot items from cold items, and disinfecting hands with alcohol when ordering fast food."}
{"translation": "Though there were real money inside the register for us to get used to, the receipt was printed with the word \"training\" in large letters, and the person on the other side was wearing the same uniform as us and was our part-timer colleague, so it felt like we were playing pretend shopping."}
{"translation": "My younger sister, who was two years younger than me, was a \"normal\" child, not to mention avoiding me, but rather admiring me."}
{"translation": "When my sister was scolded by my mother for something ordinary, I approached my mother and asked her \"Why are you angry?\" to find out the reason."}
{"translation": "My sister always thanked me as if I had been protected when the lecture ended because I asked my mother a question."}
{"translation": "I, who had little interest in sweets and toys, often gave them to my younger sister."}
{"translation": "So, my sister always followed me around."}
{"translation": "\"Dad, I like yakitori, so let's make and eat this today."}
{"translation": "\"  I repeated it in a clear voice, wondering if she hadn't heard it well."}
{"translation": "My mother gave a start, and the other mothers around us seemed surprised as their eyes, noses, and mouths opened wide all at once."}
{"translation": "I was about to laugh at the strange face, but when I saw that person staring at my hands, I thought, \"It's not enough with just one bird."}
{"translation": "\"Should I bring more?\""}
{"translation": "Glancing at the sparrows walking side by side nearby, my mother, who had finally come to her senses, shouted desperately in a voice as if scolding me, \"Keiko!\"  \"Let's make a grave and bury the little bird,\" said my wife."}
{"translation": "\"Look, everyone is crying too."}
{"translation": "It's sad that your friend has passed away."}
{"translation": "Isn't it sad?\""}
{"translation": "\"Why? What a waste of death."}
{"translation": "My mother was speechless to my question."}
{"translation": "Quickly put the canned coffee, cigarettes, and Americano into an S-size bag."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, the man who had been jingling coins in his pocket suddenly reached into his breast pocket as if he had remembered something."}
{"translation": "From his gesture, I instantly judged that he was going to pay with electronic money."}
{"translation": "\"Welcome! Good morning!\""}
{"translation": "I exchanged a slight bow and accepted the can of coffee offered by the male customer."}
{"translation": "\"Ah, and one pack of cigarettes, number five."}
{"translation": "\"Understood."}
{"translation": "Quickly remove the Marlboro Light Menthol and scan it at the register."}
{"translation": "\"Please confirm your age with a touch."}
{"translation": "The man's gaze shifted quickly to the show case where the fast food was lined up while he was touching the screen, and he stopped his finger movement."}
{"translation": "I usually ask if they would like to buy something, but when they seem to be hesitating, I take a step back and wait."}
{"translation": "I turned in response to the faint sound of coins, and looked towards the cash register."}
{"translation": "People who jingle coins in their hands or pockets are usually those who are about to buy cigarettes or a newspaper quickly and go home, so they are sensitive to the sound of money."}
{"translation": "Sure enough, there was a man approaching the register with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand stuck in his pocket."}
{"translation": "I quickly moved inside the store and slid into the checkout counter, standing inside to wait so as not to keep the customers waiting."}
{"translation": "The convenience store was filled with noise."}
{"translation": "The sound of the chime when customers come in, and the voice of the idol promoting new products on the radio in the store."}
{"translation": "The sound of the barcode being scanned by the shop clerk's call."}
{"translation": "The sound of things being put into a basket, the sound of a bag of bread being held, and the sound of heels walking around the store."}
{"translation": "Everything blends together to form the \"sound of convenience stores\" that lingers in my eardrums."}
