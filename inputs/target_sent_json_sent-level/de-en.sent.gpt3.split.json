{"translation": "\"Be quiet,\" the optician said again, louder this time, and he walked faster."}
{"translation": "\"Selma rarely finds anything threatening or ugly."}
{"translation": "He was absolutely right, but unfortunately he had said more than he should have in response to the voices."}
{"translation": "But perhaps Love would find her unappealing, the voices hissed."}
{"translation": "There must be a reason, they said, why the truth was kept hidden for so long."}
{"translation": "\"That was cowardice,\" said the optician, shifting the leather satchel to the other hip, as the jostling of the bag and the jostling of the voices were beginning to hurt."}
{"translation": "\"It was prudence,\" the voices said."}
{"translation": "\"Fear can sometimes be a good advisor,\" they said, humming the theme song of the evening show."}
{"translation": "The optician was now slowing down."}
{"translation": "The way to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly seemed to him like a day's journey, a day's journey with a lot, a lot of baggage."}
{"translation": "That's true."}
{"translation": "The dog was snow-muddy in color, he was washed-out gray and shaggy like an exclusive Irish wolfhound with nothing else mixed in."}
{"translation": "His body was still small, but his paws were as big as a bear's, and we all knew what that meant."}
{"translation": "Selma was still standing in front of the kitchen counter."}
{"translation": "She looked at the dog for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as Farmer H\u00e4ubel had been all his life."}
{"translation": "He was certain that death would not snatch his life away, but would take it gently from his hand."}
{"translation": "He imagined Death knocking cautiously, opening the door only a crack and asking \"May I?\", to which Bauer H\u00e4ubel would naturally answer yes."}
{"translation": "\"Of course,\" Bauer H\u00e4ubel would say, \"come right in,\" and Death would enter."}
{"translation": "He would stand by Farmer H\u00e4ubel's bed and ask: \"Is it comfortable for you now? I can also come by at a later time."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel would straighten up and say, \"No, no, it suits me just fine."}
{"translation": "Let's not postpone it again, who knows when you'll be able to arrange it again,\" and Death would sit down on the chair already provided at the head of the table."}
{"translation": "He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which Bauer H\u00e4ubel knew would not bother him at all, and then he would place a hand over Bauer H\u00e4ubel's eyes."}
{"translation": "The people in the village were uneasy, it was visible on their faces, even though most of them tried to hide it."}
{"translation": "This morning, a few hours after Selma's dream, the people in the village moved as if lightning ice had formed on all paths, not only outside, but also in the houses, lightning ice in the kitchens and living rooms."}
{"translation": "They moved as if their own bodies were foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly combustible."}
{"translation": "All day long they kept a watchful eye on their own lives, and on everyone else's, as much as they could."}
{"translation": "Again and again they looked behind them to check if someone was coming after them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and thus had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked forward again, because someone without a mind could just as well attack them head-on."}
{"translation": "They looked up to avoid any falling roof tiles, branches, or heavy lampshades."}
{"translation": "They avoided all animals, believing that evil spirits could escape from them more quickly than from humans."}
{"translation": "They made a wide circle around the gentle cows, who might kick today, they avoided the dogs, even the very old ones who could hardly stand, but who might still jump at their throats today."}
{"translation": "On days like these, anything was possible; even a decrepit old dachshund could bite through your throat, which was no more absurd than an okapi."}
{"translation": "Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, most people in the village were not superstitious."}
{"translation": "They carelessly did all the things that superstition forbids:"}
{"translation": "They sat calmly beneath wall clocks, even though superstition says that it can kill you, and they slept with their heads towards the door, even though superstition says that you will soon be carried out of it feet first."}
{"translation": "They hung laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, was considered superstitious to be equivalent to suicide or aiding in murder."}
{"translation": "They were not startled when the owl called out at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled with its head bowed at night."}
{"translation": "The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops along the way."}
{"translation": "Since our first train ride, we always played the same game: We stood with our backs to the windows at the opposite train doors, Martin closed his eyes, and I looked out of the window of the door behind Martin."}
{"translation": "In the first class, I had listed for Martin all the things I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize them all."}
{"translation": "This went very well, so that in the second school year I no longer had to list anything, and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything I saw through the fogged-up train window: \"Wire factory,\" he said, just as we were passing the wire factory."}
{"translation": "\"Now march."}
{"translation": "Graze."}
{"translation": "The farm of the madman Hassel."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Lookout point one."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Grazing, grazing."}
{"translation": "Tire factory."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "Graze."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Platform two."}
{"translation": "Woodland."}
{"translation": "Court."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Lookout Post Three."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "\"What else could it have been?\""}
{"translation": "Selma said, noting that it would be hard to mistake an okapi for any other animal."}
{"translation": "\"But,\" I said, \"it could have also been a deformed bull, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the rust-red color, one can't really make out those details in the night, everything is very blurry then."}
{"translation": "\"That's nonsense,\" Selma said, rubbing her forehead."}
{"translation": "\"That's just nonsense, Luise."}
{"translation": "She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it up, and placed it in my lunchbox."}
{"translation": "\"Do you know when exactly you had that dream?\""}
{"translation": "\"Around three o'clock,\" said Selma."}
{"translation": "She had been startled awake after the image of the okapi had receded, sitting upright in bed, she had stared at her nightgown, in which she had just been standing on the Uhlheck in her dream, and then at the alarm clock."}
{"translation": "Three o'clock."}
{"translation": "\"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously,\" Selma said, but she said it like a TV detective who isn't taking an anonymous letter too seriously."}
{"translation": "\"What is it?\""}
{"translation": "I asked."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma trilled, opening the refrigerator and taking out a package of sliced cheese and a liverwurst, which she waved around in the air."}
{"translation": "\"What would you like on your school sandwich today?\" she cooed."}
{"translation": "\"Mousie,\" she trilled after him, and trilling and \"Mousie\" were truly alarming."}
{"translation": "\"Cheese, please,\" I said."}
{"translation": "\"What's wrong?\""}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma trilled, \"I said so."}
{"translation": "She spread butter on a slice of bread, and since she was still slouching, she pushed the cheese off the counter with her wrist."}
{"translation": "Selma now remained silent and looked down at the cheese package, as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces."}
{"translation": "Selma had dreamed of an okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, so we were convinced that the dream of an okapi and death were necessarily connected."}
{"translation": "Our minds work this way."}
{"translation": "He can make the most disparate things belong together in the shortest amount of time."}
{"translation": "For example, coffee pots and shoelaces, or bottles for deposits and Christmas trees."}
{"translation": "When I slept downstairs with Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at the edge of the bed."}
{"translation": "When I was younger, I used to take hold of her wrist after the stories, place my thumb on her pulse, and imagine that the entire world was doing everything in time with Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the shopkeeper stocking juice bags, my mother stacking pine branches, my father stamping recipes, and all of them doing it in perfect time with Selma's heart rhythm."}
{"translation": "I had always reliably fallen asleep to this, but now, at ten years old, Selma said I was too old for it."}
