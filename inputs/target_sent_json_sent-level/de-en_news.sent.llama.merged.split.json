{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS ON Fahrenheit."}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new range of possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression that could push the boundaries of the world."}
{"translation": "She presented me with an opportunity to explore new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century."}
{"translation": "\"Centuries ago\""}
{"translation": "To be quite honest, the next ten years didn't satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, emotion-conveying medium."}
{"translation": "Even if this could have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is still the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that an interactive experience can be created that is not just about fighting disgusting monsters in dark corridors and barricading oneself behind crates to obtain ammunition, but rather has far more complex and deeper content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will contribute to changing your mind about them."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition."}
{"translation": "The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything for the first time."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a significant part of our lives and presented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, repeatedly challenging us to question many of the principles we had previously considered unshakeable."}

{"translation": "When I invest in equipment worth many thousands of euros, I unfortunately also have to spend money on a decent backpack."}

{"translation": "In that part, it's all about Volt and Taylor's feelings, and I found it unnecessary to drag it out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is then like a small child during every argument, getting all upset?!."}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor would stand up for him and try to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he had heard it himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and struggles with Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would add more tension to the story again."}

{"translation": "Through frequent removal and reinsertion of the phone into the case, the lid has become so worn out that it now detaches from the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "\"There may not be many major flaws, but I still find that a battery-powered shell should function flawlessly in its intended function, and therefore I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I've only been using it for 3 months, and it cost me 30\u20ac."}
{"translation": "\"Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing\""}
{"translation": "I don't know how these excellent reviews came about."}
{"translation": "It's actually just a microfiber cloth for cleaning glasses, which you can get in a slightly smaller size as a gift at any optician's."}

{"translation": "Poor service from manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded our money."}
{"translation": "A praise for Amazon."}
{"translation": "\"Spend a little more money\""}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered that need to be assembled by yourself."}
{"translation": "The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no further protection."}
{"translation": "The postman stuffed the product into my mailbox, damaging a few templates."}
{"translation": "I did not criticize it, because I urgently needed this product."}
{"translation": "Already a day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive material had not dried (at least it was still not dry five days after application), one must be very careful not to stick everything together."}
{"translation": "The templates are partially incomplete."}
{"translation": "For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "I am not dissatisfied."}
{"translation": "The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic closure + beautiful design + stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned freely."}
{"translation": "\"Conclusion: If he didn't look so good and didn't have such good measurements, I would give him fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit perfectly to be truly satisfied."}
{"translation": "Moreover, I find him a bit too expensive for that."}
{"translation": "The coffee tastes good to me."}
{"translation": ".. but."}
{"translation": ".. there are only three stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjective, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive)."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a deduction of one star for me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and scores full points soon."}
{"translation": "\"Geht mir auf den Wecker\" translates to \"Gets on my nerves\"."}
{"translation": "The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "But: the natural sounds are terrifying, and extremely loud to boot."}
{"translation": "I couldn't turn them down either."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, allegedly possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was still too loud for me, so I immediately fell out of bed."}
{"translation": "\"Moreover, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast a shadow on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I had turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already morning."}
{"translation": "The colors and the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately, one cannot dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "I also found it good that he has a battery, so that the clock and alarm time do not have to be re-entered in case of a power outage."}
{"translation": "However, I went back for the reasons mentioned."}
{"translation": "\"Light super, processing inadequate\""}
{"translation": "I have replaced four light sources in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "There was nothing in the carton."}
{"translation": "Amazon should have definitely taken care of it quickly and easily, but I only realized it after the return deadline had passed."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I see it as my mistake and live with it."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit."}
{"translation": "The light color tends towards cold white."}
{"translation": "\"Perfect for hallway, office, workshop, laundry room, etc."}
{"translation": "\" For living spaces, I would personally opt for warmer lighting."}
{"translation": "\"Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt light bulb."}
{"translation": "Other lamps can do that too, and maybe I'll even get intact samples there corresponding to the order."}
{"translation": "Should my assessment be of help, I am pleased about a positive assessment."}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great!"}
{"translation": "I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first glance."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive."}
{"translation": "I have long considered whether to order this set or not."}
{"translation": "The material is stable and it feels good in the hand."}
{"translation": "The utensils all have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up."}
{"translation": "The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical for use on coated pans."}
{"translation": "They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 \u2109."}
{"translation": "You don't pass on the heat and thus can be touched directly."}
{"translation": "The dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But shortly after wiping and they're gone."}
{"translation": "Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend."}
{"translation": "\"B-Ware sold as new\""}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, the water faucet disassembled and all parts checked."}
{"translation": "Here, we found that the part had already been assembled before."}
{"translation": "We have observed significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts."}
{"translation": "The connections/couplings of the hoses were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Despite that, we have installed the part into the washbasin (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only now did we notice that scratch marks/streaks are also visible on the chromed water faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This part was probably delivered and returned before."}
{"translation": "We'll keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion."}
{"translation": "We'll never order such goods from Amazon again, instead we'll pay a bit more at the hardware store where we get decent quality."}
{"translation": "I find it simply depressing that customers are being ripped off like this!!!."}
{"translation": "Product excellent, outdoor sensor unfortunately defective after 6 months."}
{"translation": "Fundamentally, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation went very smoothly, and the range is also very good, with no problems whatsoever with transmission from inside to outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is very simple in design and can either be mounted on the wall or stood up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after approximately."}
{"translation": "The device that measures values outside seems to be broken after half a year of use."}
{"translation": "While the thermometer still appears to be intact, it continues to display plausible values."}
{"translation": "The hygrometer is probably broken, since it consistently displays completely astronomical values for outdoor humidity."}
{"translation": "That's a shame, as the device was installed in a protected location and that's also why I can only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Strong mower with weak catcher."}
{"translation": "\"Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still roaming the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service in triggering a replacement delivery was, as always, outstanding."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression."}
{"translation": "The engine is powerful and it results in a beautiful cutting image."}
{"translation": "The volume level is not particularly impressively low, but okay."}
{"translation": "Big drawback is unfortunately the cage."}
{"translation": "He is made of hard plastic on the top and bottom and fabric in between."}
{"translation": "When you compress him fully, he will naturally be crushed and parts of the content will fall out."}
{"translation": "Worse yet, the practical fill level indicator already shows red at half capacity."}
{"translation": "That wouldn't be so bad, if the mower didn't lose large parts of the cutting material from then on."}
{"translation": "The solution cannot be to empty the basket at a large grassy area when it is only half full."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back."}
{"translation": "\"In conclusion, a very good mower overall, but unfortunately rendered unsuitable for me due to the poor design of the catcher."}
{"translation": "Good surveillance device."}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated via the app."}
{"translation": "Very good is the included detachable sensor cable, which can also be extended when needed."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery life, they are only displayed once or three times a day (adjustable) in the app."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons, I can only give 4 stars."}
{"translation": "This device loses its network connection every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect on its own, even when placed near the router."}
{"translation": "One must remove the batteries and pause briefly before reinsertion, and it will connect again."}
{"translation": "That should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There's always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer."}
{"translation": "I have ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I have not been able to level my hotbed properly yet."}
{"translation": "The rear mounting screw on the right is fully tightened, yet the bed is still too high and the screw falls out forward, even though it is not tightened, because the bed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The poles that hold the wagon are straight, as well as the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what to do, because it's impossible to print anything like this."}
{"translation": "For assembly:"}
{"translation": "The assembly was relatively problem-free, one could only show how to lay the cables properly to avoid having to re-lay them multiple times, which is very tiring."}
{"translation": "I have also written support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response."}
{"translation": "\"Unfortunately, sending it back is not an option anymore."}
{"translation": "\"I had expected a bit more."}
{"translation": "\"Robust and precise, I am positively surprised."}
{"translation": "My old calculator has unfortunately stopped working after many years, so I had to get a new one."}
{"translation": "This one makes a very robust impression and has been proven to be equally precise after multiple testing."}
{"translation": "\"Two batteries are included, so you can start right away."}
{"translation": "\"The packaging of the slipper is simple, yet fully serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the scraper leaves no wishes unfulfilled and has all necessary measuring methods at its disposal."}
{"translation": "I can only give him full marks for that and I believe he'll last at least as long as the old measuring instrument."}
{"translation": "\"There is a clear buying recommendation and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell."}
{"translation": "I bought the armband and haven't worn it yet, because it emits a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "The smell has not gone away until today, even though it has been \"aired out\" constantly."}
{"translation": "After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it."}
{"translation": "\"Rate vom Kauf ab\" translates to \"Advise against the purchase."}
{"translation": "Okay for the price."}
{"translation": "The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too large for my personal taste, so it looks quite massive."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice again."}
{"translation": "However, the kettle is overall very simply constructed, so I have already opened the lid twice."}
{"translation": "I've been able to repair him every time so far, but I think that won't last much longer."}
{"translation": "\"You can't expect anything really high-quality for a low price."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry."}
{"translation": "One only needs to pull the end through one's mouth, it cannot rise, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I have treated it with some leather care, which makes it softer and more pliable."}
{"translation": "Only those with a magnetic arm:"}
{"translation": "The zipper is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, junk!"}
{"translation": "I was disappointed even after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was in order."}
{"translation": "Now for the function:"}
{"translation": "It only connects after some fiddling."}
{"translation": ".. doesn't work at all when following the instructions, but after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the senders finally connected."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, as the connection was lost again after only an hour, even though the transmitters were right next to the base station."}
{"translation": "The announcement of the three senders was also very different!"}
{"translation": "\"Everything is completely useless to me!\""}
{"translation": "The thing went back!"}
{"translation": "\"I would definitely advise against buying it, it's nothing but trouble!\""}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft had rusted after 3. 5 years."}
{"translation": "I only bought it again for one reason:"}
{"translation": "I urgently needed it because of the current drought, and I knew the connections of the suction hose and the drain would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will last longer."}
{"translation": "The cardboard was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in the future, rather than just using a thin cardboard box."}
{"translation": "I kept the pump despite the cracks in the plastic housing, as described above, because I urgently needed the pump and the cracks did not affect the pump's performance."}
{"translation": "One could have thought it through better."}
{"translation": "Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I find it more convenient to have an organizer rather than carrying a huge key ring around all the time."}
{"translation": "At first, everything went well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint job didn't last long and the screws had to be tightened repeatedly."}
{"translation": "Nice that it also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin."}
{"translation": "I couldn't find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw."}
{"translation": "Now let's get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: the key handover."}
{"translation": "\"Nice that one can adjust the screw in different parts to different sizes."}
{"translation": "One should first disassemble the whole thing using a wrench before trying to stretch it, otherwise one will need pliers to take it apart again."}
{"translation": "Finally, the screw broke off in the thread during the third attempt at assembly, rendering the entire thing unusable."}
{"translation": "\"In conclusion: If at all, then only once for all the necessary keys, and never again, but at that price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite match the specified dimensions."}
{"translation": "Easy-to-use zippers, the material feels robust, and it's all in featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to truly evaluate the product after its first use."}
{"translation": "I can already say that the height is lower than stated in advance."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't really imagine it yet, everything there, for example."}
{"translation": "To pack for a three-week vacation."}
{"translation": "Note that 10 parts were delivered instead of 8, as the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller pouches/tubes."}
{"translation": "Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetics bag has a different color tone and is made of different material than the other bags does not personally bother me."}
{"translation": "\"So silly\", \"So foolish\", \"So nonsensical\", \"So absurd\""}
{"translation": "\"Also, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it anymore."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Exchanged."}
{"translation": "But he still doesn't work properly."}
{"translation": "I could have thrown the money directly into the trash can too."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but one should be very careful when approaching the needle to avoid damaging it."}
{"translation": "I couldn't hear an improvement in sound quality from my very high-end record player."}
{"translation": "Long battery life."}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "There were two black cables."}
{"translation": "\"Battery life lasts very long."}
{"translation": "Definitely completely sufficient sound."}
{"translation": "I'm really impressed that the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and don't cause any pain."}
{"translation": "The earplugs are completely soft and comfortable to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also very low."}
{"translation": "\"Recommendation for purchases in this price range."}
{"translation": "Nice dress"}
{"translation": "Very beautiful dress that is versatile and suitable for various occasions."}
{"translation": "Price-performance ratio is spot on here, especially since I also got it on a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits me perfectly in size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as it was recommended)."}
{"translation": "I would have wished for a less deep cut and sleeves that could handle a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slender upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "Overall, a stylish dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Hands off, Keep your hands off \"Things can't get any worse."}
{"translation": "I would not have expected in good faith that such junk is being sold nowadays."}
{"translation": "The hardware is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the USB connections provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Despite this, a fault-free operation of this hardware is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs play normally, Blu-rays are recognized with varying degrees of reliability."}
{"translation": "The discs must be inserted multiple times, and then it makes grinding noises like those not heard since the 90s from old PCs and the earliest CD-ROM drives."}
{"translation": "After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing is happening anymore or the disc will finally be recognized."}
{"translation": "Then, one must not press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the film, or do anything else."}
{"translation": "\"That leads immediately to an irreparable freeze."}
{"translation": "\"Furthermore, no Blu-ray software is included."}
{"translation": "When one purchases PowerDVD or similar additional software, the price of this device doubles."}
{"translation": "\"It does what it should, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First and foremost, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually misleading, since only the port facing upwards is a genuine USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and would have been fine with a cheap extension, but I certainly wouldn't have bought this awkward lump with golden connectors."}
{"translation": "\"However, setting aside its appearance and my initial misgivings, the extension has performed its duty very reliably."}
{"translation": "And the weight of the plug means that the inserted USB stick doesn't dangle freely in the area like a regular extension cord."}
{"translation": "Not a real mistake, but my euphoria is limited."}
{"translation": "Small but oh!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display."}
{"translation": "With iOS 12, you can now transfer data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "The audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters that I had to send back could not do this unfortunately."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to my tablet and the HDMI connected to my TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous loading is no problem."}
{"translation": "\"Ton\" will be delivered over HDMI."}
{"translation": "What do I still need my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter that could be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder."}
{"translation": "\"My cover doesn't fit with the adapter."}
{"translation": "\"Yeah, it's definitely safe and has contact from there."}
{"translation": "Everything is a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "Additionally, it's very small and made of aluminum for added stability."}
{"translation": "Price-performance ratio fits."}
{"translation": "A lot of performance."}
{"translation": "Top device"}
{"translation": "Has been running smoothly for months."}
{"translation": "It's not exactly easy or quiet, but it brings decent performance."}
{"translation": "I find the medium temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2."}
{"translation": "Has also fallen onto the tiles several times and survived well."}
{"translation": "And the simple design pleases me too."}
{"translation": "Competitor products would love to look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good."}
{"translation": "The brush head's processing has made a very good impression, despite the significant price difference compared to the original, which does not give a cheap impression."}
{"translation": "In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can recommend them without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great!"}
{"translation": "We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised."}
{"translation": "The live mode location is accurate to within 0. 5 meters."}
{"translation": "In offline mode when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump around a few meters, but this is not disturbing."}
{"translation": "I would buy him again anytime."}
{"translation": "What would be really great would be a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "He currently holds out for around 1. 5 days."}
{"translation": "\"Here's a solution that would take 7-14 days to implement."}
{"translation": "There is indeed an XL version, but unfortunately it's too large for our taste, the battery wouldn't last long and we would find it impractical to have to change it every day."}
{"translation": "One should occupy oneself with the dog, not its collar."}
{"translation": "The app worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks, trash."}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and seem comfortable."}
{"translation": "The lifespan is decreasing steadily."}
{"translation": "Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the soles are already worn out after just a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore."}
{"translation": "During normal use, the last pair didn't last very long either, but I thought it would be sufficient for the lesson."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that wasn't the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs finally broke after 5 years, so I'm eagerly awaiting my new order."}
{"translation": "These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are as comfortable as the ones I had before."}
{"translation": "At first glance, no difference is apparent, but upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel is loose and unlikely to last five years like my previous ones."}
{"translation": "I am excited!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good."}
{"translation": "There were hardly any reviews available, so I was initially very skeptical."}
{"translation": "Since I'll be attending a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I've booked it on a whim. ."}
{"translation": "The delivery scope included a mattress and an electric air pump."}
{"translation": "To the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I have laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing purposes."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there is mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it off and hope that it won't resurface again."}
{"translation": "In the excited state, a lie detector test was conducted directly."}
{"translation": "Or, more idiomatically:"}
{"translation": "A lie detector test was carried out immediately while he was in an excited state."}
{"translation": "It lies well and fits perfectly for the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for a few days at the event, it's pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits wonderfully into my car."}
{"translation": "We removed the seats from the back before."}
{"translation": "Therefore, it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "The air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has various adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found at the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump will be stuck into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point)."}
{"translation": "My friend's handyman skills allowed him to repair and reassemble the good part, which worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress."}
{"translation": "I'm looking forward to the hardship test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope she doesn't lose her breath and lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "\"Just as he doesn't want mold to reappear."}
{"translation": "After the test, I can definitely recommend them."}
{"translation": "If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me."}
{"translation": "For fast delivery."}
{"translation": "For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar has been torn open directly from day 1 through several flaps due to careless processing."}
{"translation": "On the 21st, there were no more doors left, and I had to more or less allow my son to remove the remaining parts as well, since they were practically falling off already."}
{"translation": "The parts often come loose, which means that you have to disassemble the car again to get the parts in."}
{"translation": "After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off during play."}
{"translation": "Mostly the windshield."}
{"translation": "I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"translation": "The manufacturers may reconsider the design of the calendar for the next edition and make it better."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am thrilled by the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it."}
{"translation": "Inside, the very good one flies and the 5 minutes."}
{"translation": "Flight time is usually sufficient."}
{"translation": "I didn't expect anything else at that price, but the drone's propellers getting tangled in hair and breaking quickly is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Crashing from the ceiling to the ground, whether it's tiles or carpet, is no issue."}
{"translation": "\"Please feel free to contact us for any questions."}
{"translation": "\"Game okay but only playable with forced Steam connection."}
{"translation": "I did not see when buying that it was not a game CD but only a code that allows you to download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be tolerable, but you're forced to install Steam to play it at all, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Ever since then, the computer keeps crashing, which wouldn't be the case with a clean installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life."}
{"translation": "I had been looking forward to the watch very much."}
{"translation": "\"Design and optics great, news etc. Displayed without any issues."}
{"translation": "\"The operation went well."}
{"translation": ".. and yet I'm sending it back."}
{"translation": "The big hook: the battery and its running time."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, just left on the shelf overnight and 11% less battery in the morning without use."}
{"translation": "Many messages came during the day, the battery was already dead by midday / early afternoon, and then you couldn't even read the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore, not useful for me."}
{"translation": "Very sad."}
{"translation": "Noble shell with limitations."}
{"translation": "One should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+."}
{"translation": "I have recently come to appreciate sleeves that can also accommodate a credit card."}
{"translation": "This offers the shell here."}
{"translation": "When you put cards in all three slots, it's too much, then the lid stands a little high."}
{"translation": "\"One is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather sleeve makes a robust impression and seems to be well-crafted."}
{"translation": "She looks noble."}
{"translation": "The phone is embedded in contrast to many other shells around it, with cutouts only at the connections."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the on/off switch and volume control can be easily operated through the housing on the sides."}
{"translation": "\"Disadvantageous is that it is not possible on some QI charging devices to charge the phone through the thickness of the case."}
{"translation": "Even at the TORRO leather charging station, it doesn't work."}
{"translation": "High-quality case with armor glass film."}
{"translation": "Robust case with proper armor glass as screen protection in a classic design offers all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11."}
{"translation": "Fits very well and can also be easily dressed up."}
{"translation": "The material is pleasant to the touch and does not soil."}
{"translation": "A truly successful and beautiful product with an excellent price-performance ratio."}
{"translation": "This case gives the phone some stability."}
{"translation": "\"It's not too cramped and is firmly attached to the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall a good purchase."}
