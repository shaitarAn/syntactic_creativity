{"translation": "The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment."}
{"translation": "It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying and sometimes subsiding."}
{"translation": "The wind would start to rustle in the bare trees and then fall silent, just as I listened to the flow of the night."}
{"translation": "But he didn't leave, he was here."}
{"translation": "I knew this from the smell of wet pebbles and the barely audible rustle of a solitary maple leaf."}
{"translation": "I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only lively companion."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, shots from a rifle could be heard coming from the darkness of the city."}
{"translation": "After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then far out at sea a dim light flickered and went out."}
{"translation": "He would make us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before."}
{"translation": "Thus, in the yellowish-brown stone there were many small sea shells firmly embedded in it, on the bushes of broom there were still a few flowers, they sat on straight, firm stems, like wet and crumpled golden butterflies, and patiently waited for the sun."}
{"translation": "But it rarely emerged in the mist as a blurry white patch, giving neither warmth nor shade."}
{"translation": "Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, leaves were lying about as if cut out of a dull green velvet."}
{"translation": "Ants were running in a line through the iron gate, carrying away the last supplies for winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain."}
{"translation": "At night on the other side of the river someone started waving a flashlight and shouting in a drawn-out voice."}
{"translation": "I went out to the shore with my uncle Ilko."}
{"translation": "The river was roaring."}
{"translation": "The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall."}
{"translation": "It was a late, silent night, and not a single star was visible in the sky."}
{"translation": "A wild freshness blew in his face, melted from the earth."}
{"translation": "And all the time someone was waving a flashlight on the other bank and shouting, but the words were lost in the noise of the river."}
{"translation": "When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black the mother."}
{"translation": "She stood motionless on the shore."}
{"translation": "She saw from there how they were taking her father away."}
{"translation": "Then she knelt down and fell with her head on the sand."}
{"translation": "No, Grandfather replied."}
{"translation": "\"That's right, we haven't seen each other."}
{"translation": "Ostap started to go blind."}
{"translation": "He had the idea of travelling to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind."}
{"translation": "He arrived at the royal capital and found out that she had died perhaps she could not bear the separation."}
{"translation": "Ostap found her grave on the cemetery made of white marble, looked at it and his heart broke his iron rose was lying on the stone."}
{"translation": "That woman bequeathed to have a rose placed on her grave."}
{"translation": "Forever."}
{"translation": "And Ostap began to sing and, maybe, he died on the road or at the market under the cart."}
{"translation": "Amen!\""}
{"translation": "On the other shore, the Countess Branitskaya's reserved forest rose up the slope."}
{"translation": "The sun could not penetrate through the thick foliage of this forest."}
{"translation": "Only occasionally a solitary ray of light pierced through the thicket and revealed to us the astonishing power of vegetation."}
{"translation": "Like sparkling dust, small birds flew into this ray of light."}
{"translation": "They chased each other with a squeal and dove into the foliage, as if into green water."}
{"translation": "I was scooping water from the pond into a bucket, throwing in some grass, and waiting."}
{"translation": "The red floats stood still in the water."}
{"translation": "Then one of them would start to flinch, let out light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away."}
{"translation": "The father was winding the line, the nut-wood rod was bending into an arc, and in the mist above the pond there was a buzzing, splashing and commotion."}
{"translation": "The water was spreading, rocking the buckets, water beetles were scurrying off in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glimmer appeared in the depths."}
{"translation": "It was impossible to tell what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp from the grass he had baited."}
{"translation": "He was lying on his side, drifting and flapping his fins."}
{"translation": "From his scales emanated an amazing smell of the underwater kingdom."}
{"translation": "Yasha counted the seconds to himself."}
{"translation": "We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium."}
{"translation": "Behind the high fence and iron gates of the sanatorium, we always felt completely safe."}
{"translation": "Especially if they didn't light the stove."}
{"translation": "As we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled."}
{"translation": "Then, when we remembered the incident in the Sturdzov alley, Yasha insisted that if you want to do something in the best way, you will always fail on a trifle."}
{"translation": "I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything."}
{"translation": "But I kept quiet so as not to upset Yasha."}
{"translation": "We crept along the alley."}
{"translation": "I said that we should go on the other side of the gateway, not reaching it, stop and listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass by the gateway."}
{"translation": "I believe the calculation was mathematically accurate."}
{"translation": "If there are people in the alleyway, they may not even notice us."}
{"translation": "If we go in the opposite direction from the alley, we can be seen from a distance."}
{"translation": "I calculated that in the last case we would be going against a dangerous alleyway, or rather, we would be visible to the people hiding in the alleyway for five times longer."}
{"translation": "Therefore, there will be five times more chances for us to be noticed."}
{"translation": "In the morning I would wake up from the hot sun beating against the white walls."}
{"translation": "Red and yellow pansies swayed outside the open window."}
{"translation": "Along with them, a nasturtium flower peeked into the room."}
{"translation": "A furry bee was sitting in it."}
{"translation": "I stood still, watching as she angrily wriggled and freed herself from the tight flower."}
{"translation": "Streams of light ran endlessly across the ceiling, gentle waves reflections of the river."}
{"translation": "The river was roaring nearby."}
