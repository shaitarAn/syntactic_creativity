{"translation": "\"Keep your trap shut,\" the optician said again, louder this time, and walked faster."}
{"translation": "\"Selma hardly ever finds anything threatening or unattractive."}
{"translation": "He was absolutely right, and he unfortunately said more than he should have replied to the voices."}
{"translation": "But love might just find her unattractive after all, the voices whispered, there must be a reason why the truth was hidden for so long."}
{"translation": "\"Cowardice was it,\" said the optician, shifting the leather bag to the other hip, as the rustling of the bag and the rustling of voices began to grate on him."}
{"translation": "\"Common sense was it,\" said the voices, \"Fear can be a good advisor sometimes,\" they said, humming the theme tune of the evening series."}
{"translation": "The optician became slower."}
{"translation": "The way to Selma's house, which actually took ten minutes, suddenly seemed to him like a day trip, a day trip with an awful lot of luggage."}
{"translation": "That was correct."}
{"translation": "The dog was dappled grey, he was washed out and shaggy like an exclusive Irish Wolfhound without anything else in him."}
{"translation": "His body was still small, but his paws were as large as bear's paws, and we all knew what that meant."}
{"translation": "Selma still stood upright in front of the kitchen counter."}
{"translation": "She looked at the dog for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just like Farmer H\u00e4ubel had been throughout his life."}
{"translation": "He was certain that death would not snatch life away from him, but rather take it gently from his hand."}
{"translation": "He pictured death carefully rapping on the door, opening it just a slit, and asking \"May I?\" which farmer H\u00e4ubel would of course answer with a yes."}
{"translation": "\"Of course,\" Bauer H\u00e4ubel would say, \"just step inside,\" and death would ensue."}
{"translation": "He would stand at Farmer H\u00e4ubel's bed and ask: \"Is it comfortable for you now?"}
{"translation": "\"I can also come by at a later time."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel would straighten up and say, \"No, no, it fits me very well,\""}
{"translation": "\"Let's not put it off again, who knows when you'll be able to set it up again,\" and Death would sit down on the already prepared chair at the head of the table."}
{"translation": "He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which, Bauer H\u00e4ubel knew, would not affect him at all, and then place a hand on Bauer H\u00e4ubel's eyes."}
{"translation": "The villagers were uneasy, it was plain to see, even though they mostly tried to hide it."}
{"translation": "This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved about as if lightning had formed on all paths, not only outside, but also inside the houses, lightning in the kitchens and living rooms."}
{"translation": "They moved as if their own bodies were completely foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable."}
{"translation": "They spent the whole day grumbling about their own lives and, as far as possible, those of others."}
{"translation": "They kept looking back to check if someone was creeping up on them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked back to the front again because someone without a mind could also attack head-on."}
{"translation": "They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles, branches, or heavy lampshades."}
{"translation": "They feared all animals because they believed they could break out of them more quickly than out of humans."}
{"translation": "They made a detour around the docile cows that might possibly calve today, avoiding the dogs as well, even the very old ones that could barely stand, but might still go for their throats today."}
{"translation": "On days like these, anything was possible."}
{"translation": "Even a mangy dachshund could bite through a person's throat, and that was far more outlandish than an okapi."}
{"translation": "Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were not superstitious."}
{"translation": "They did nonchalantly all the things that one must not do when superstitious:."}
{"translation": "They sat calmly under the clocks, even though superstition dictates that one can die from doing so, with their heads towards the door, even though superstition says that means they'll be carried out feet-first through that very door soon."}
{"translation": "They hung out laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, is considered a superstition akin to suicide or murder."}
{"translation": "They did not shudder when the owl cried at night, when a horse sweated profusely in the stable, when a dog howled with its head lowered."}
{"translation": "The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, there was no stop."}
{"translation": "Since our first train ride, we always played the same game: We stood with our backs to the windows opposite the train doors, Martin closed his eyes, and I looked out the window of the door behind him."}
{"translation": "In the first class, I listed to Martin what I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize everything."}
{"translation": "That worked out very well, so that in the second school year, I didn't have to list anything else, and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything that I saw through the barred window: \"Wire factory,\" he said, exactly at the moment when we passed by the wire factory."}
{"translation": "Now field."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "The farm of the crazy Hassel."}
{"translation": "Meadow Forest Forest."}
{"translation": "High seat one."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Meadow, meadow."}
{"translation": "Tire factory Village."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "High seat two."}
{"translation": "Wooded area or forest patch Farm."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "High seat three."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "\"What else could it have been,\" said Selma, and that you couldn't possibly mistake an okapi for any other animal."}
{"translation": "\"But,\" I said, \"it could have been a grown-up ox, a misassembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the reddish-brown color, you couldn't make out all of that exactly in the dark, everything was pretty blurry."}
{"translation": "\" \"That's nonsense,\" said Selma, rubbing her forehead, \"that's unfortunately nonsense, Luise."}
{"translation": "She placed a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it together, and put it in my butter bread box."}
{"translation": "Do you know exactly when you dreamed that?"}
{"translation": "\"At three o'clock,\" said Selma."}
{"translation": "She was startled, after the picture of the okapi had retreated, sitting upright in bed, she woke up and stared at her nightgown, in which she had just stood on the Uhlheck in her dream, and then at the alarm clock."}
{"translation": "Three o'clock."}
{"translation": "\"We should probably not take this too seriously,\" said Selma, but she said it like a TV commissioner who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously."}
{"translation": "\"What's up?\", I asked."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma whistled, opened the refrigerator, fetched a package of sliced cheese and a liver sausage, and swung both through the air."}
{"translation": "\"Little mouse,\" she whistled after it, and the flute and the mouse were now really alarming."}
{"translation": "\"Cheese, please,\" I said, \"what do you have?\"."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma said, \"I didn't say anything."}
{"translation": "She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as it was still slippery, she pushed the cheese off the cutting board with her wrist."}
{"translation": "Selma held still and gazed down at the cheese packaging as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces."}
{"translation": "Selma had dreamed of an okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, which is why we were convinced that the dream of an okapi and death were inevitably connected."}
{"translation": "Our understanding works that way."}
{"translation": "He can ensure that the most disparate things belong together in no time."}
{"translation": "Coffee cans and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and fir trees."}
{"translation": "When I was sleeping with Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at bedtime."}
{"translation": "When I was younger, I would always hold onto my mother's wrist and place my thumb on her pulse, imagining that the whole world was beating in rhythm with her heart."}
{"translation": "I pictured the optician polishing lenses, Martin exerting himself, Elsbeth cutting her hedge, the retailer packing juice boxes, my mother layering fir branches, my father stamping recipes, and everyone doing it in perfect sync with Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "I have always relied on it to fall asleep, but now, at ten years old, Selma thinks I'm too old for it."}
