{"translation": "Perhaps because Miho and Satsuki often meet in their hometown, they have similar expressions and ways of speaking."}
{"translation": "Their way of eating sweets is particularly similar, both delicately breaking cookies into smaller pieces with their manicured hands before bringing them to their mouths."}
{"translation": "I wonder if it's been like this since before, but when I try to recall, my memory is vague."}
{"translation": "I sometimes think that the little habits and gestures of the two people we met before might have already flowed away somewhere."}
{"translation": "Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family home in her hometown, where her friends often gather."}
{"translation": "There are times when I dread having to work part-time again tomorrow, but it's my only connection with a world outside the convenience store, and a valuable opportunity to interact with other \"average women in their thirties\" like Miho."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I try to accept Miho's invitations whenever possible."}
{"translation": "Today, as always, Miho, Yukari with her small child, Satsuki who is married but without children and I got together."}
{"translation": "We brought cakes to Miho's house and had tea."}
{"translation": "At that moment, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time."}
{"translation": "I thought I was born just now."}
{"translation": "As a normal part of the world, I was indeed born on this day."}
{"translation": "For the two weeks leading up to the opening, persistent practice continued with partners and staff acting as fictitious customers."}
{"translation": "Look into the \"customer's\" eyes, smile and bow, put sanitary products into a paper bag, separate hot items from cold ones, and if asked for fast food, sanitize your hands with alcohol."}
{"translation": "In order to get accustomed to handling money, the cash register was filled with real money, but the receipt had \"Training\" printed in large letters on it."}
{"translation": "And since my counterpart was a part-timer like me wearing the same uniform, it kind of felt like we were playing pretend shopping."}
{"translation": "My younger sister, unlike me, was a \"normal\" child."}
{"translation": "But that didn't mean she shied away from me; on the contrary, she admired me."}
{"translation": "When my sister was being scolded by our mother for something ordinary, unlike me, I approached my mother and asked, \"Why are you angry?\""}
{"translation": "When the lecture from our mother ended due to the question I had asked, my sister always said \"Thank you\" to me, perhaps thinking she had been saved by me."}
{"translation": "I wasn't really interested in sweets or toys, and often gave them to my younger sister."}
{"translation": "Therefore, my younger sister was always following me around."}
{"translation": "\"Dad, because you like yakitori, let's grill and eat this today."}
{"translation": "Wondering whether he had not heard me clearly, I repeated it in a distinct pronunciation."}
{"translation": "My mother was surprised, and the other kid's mom next to her also seemed shocked as her eyes, nostrils and mouth all opened wide at once."}
{"translation": "I almost laughed because of his strange face, but when I saw him staring at my hands, I thought, right, one is not enough."}
{"translation": "\"Should I get more?\""}
{"translation": "When I glanced at the sparrows walking in a row nearby, my mother, who finally came to her senses, shouted desperately in a scolding tone, \"Keiko!\""}
{"translation": "\"Let's make a grave for the little bird and bury it."}
{"translation": "See, everyone else is crying too."}
{"translation": "It's sad that our friend has passed away, isn't it?"}
{"translation": "\"Hey, isn't it pitiful?\""}
{"translation": "\"Why? Even though they're already dead. .."}
{"translation": "At my question, my mother was left speechless."}
{"translation": "Put canned coffee, cigarettes, and corn dogs into a small-sized bag quickly."}
{"translation": "During that time, the man who had been jingling the coins in his pocket suddenly seemed to have an idea and put his hand into his breast pocket."}
{"translation": "From that gesture, I instantly judge that they're going to make the payment with electronic money."}
{"translation": "\"Welcome, good morning!\""}
{"translation": "With a slight bow, I take the canned coffee offered by the male customer."}
{"translation": "\"Ah, and one of the number five cigarettes,\" \"Understood."}
{"translation": "I quickly pull out a Marlboro Light Menthol and scan it at the register."}
{"translation": "\"Please touch for age verification."}
{"translation": "While touching the screen, he sees the man's gaze smoothly shift to the fast food lined up in the showcase, and stops his finger movements."}
{"translation": "\"Would you like something?\""}
{"translation": "I always offer, but when the customer seems undecided about making a purchase, I step back and wait."}
{"translation": "I turn around in response to the faint sound of loose change, diverting my gaze towards the cash register."}
{"translation": "People who jingle coins in their hands or pockets are often those who are looking to quickly buy cigarettes or a newspaper and return home, so they are sensitive to the sound of money."}
{"translation": "Sure enough, there was a man approaching the cash register with a can of coffee in one hand and the other hand stuck in his pocket."}
{"translation": "Quickly move around the store and slip into the cash register counter, standing inside so as not to keep customers waiting."}
{"translation": "The convenience store is filled with sound."}
{"translation": "The sound of the chime as customers enter, the voice of an idol promoting new products over the store's public address system."}
{"translation": "The sound of scanning barcodes, accompanied by the clerk's calling out."}
{"translation": "The sound of items being placed in the basket, the sound of a bread bag being clenched, and the sound of heels walking around the store."}
{"translation": "Everything mixes together, becoming the \"sound of the convenience store,\" constantly touching my eardrums."}
