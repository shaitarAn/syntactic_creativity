{"translation": "The deafening sea roar never ceased for a minute."}
{"translation": "He was advancing in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding."}
{"translation": "And the wind began to rustle in the bare trees, then fell silent, just as I did, listening to the flow of the night."}
{"translation": "But he didn't leave, he was here."}
{"translation": "I knew it by the smell of damp earth and the faint tremble of a solitary plane tree leaf."}
{"translation": "I noticed that stubborn gray sheet during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, from the darkness, from the city, gunshots could be heard."}
{"translation": "After each shot, the dogs would bark for a long time."}
{"translation": "\"A dim light flickered and died far out at sea."}
{"translation": "He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many previously unnoticed qualities in them."}
{"translation": "Yes, in the damp yellow sandstone, there were many small sea shells embedded in it, and on the bushes, there were still a few colors left, they sat on straight, sturdy stems like damp, crumpled golden butterflies, and patiently waited for the sun."}
{"translation": "But it rarely emerged from the fog as a dim white patch and failed to provide either warmth or shade."}
{"translation": "Under a single ancient plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, leaves lay scattered, as if cut from dull green velvet."}
{"translation": "Along the iron railings, a procession of ants scurried, carrying their last supplies for the winter in their underground dwellings, while a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain."}
{"translation": "At night, someone on the other side of the river started flashing a flashlight and shouting prolongedly."}
{"translation": "I went out with my uncle."}
{"translation": "Ilko on the shore."}
{"translation": "The river roared."}
{"translation": "Water flowed through the dam as a cold waterfall."}
{"translation": "The night was late, dark, and starless overhead."}
{"translation": "The face was splashed with the freshness of the wild, thawed earth."}
{"translation": "And all the time, someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other bank, but the words were inaudible over the noise of the river."}
{"translation": "When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black."}
{"translation": "She stood motionless on the bank."}
{"translation": "She saw them taking her father away."}
{"translation": "She fell to her knees and dropped her head onto the sand."}
{"translation": "No, grandfather replied."}
{"translation": "It's true, we haven't seen each other."}
{"translation": "Ostap began to get angry."}
{"translation": "He decided to go to St. Petersburg then, to see that woman before he became completely blind."}
{"translation": "He reached the royal capital and learned that she had died, perhaps unable to bear the separation."}
{"translation": "I found Ostap's grave on the cemetery, made of white marble, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw his iron rose lying on the stone."}
{"translation": "The woman bequeathed to lay a rose on her grave."}
{"translation": "Forever."}
{"translation": "\"And Ostap began to play the lyre, and perhaps died on the way or at the market under a cart."}
{"translation": "Amen!"}
{"translation": "On the other bank, the forbidden forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope."}
{"translation": "The sun could not break through the dense foliage of this forest."}
{"translation": "Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light break through the dense foliage and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation."}
{"translation": "Like sparkling dust particles, small birds flew into this ray of light."}
{"translation": "They chased each other with their pees and dived into the foliage, as if into green water."}
{"translation": "I scooped water from the pond, threw in some grass, and waited."}
{"translation": "The red buoys stood motionless in the water."}
{"translation": "One of them started to twitch, made light circles, suddenly dived or quickly swam away."}
{"translation": "The father was fishing, the line was tightening, the willow branch was bending into an arc, and in the mist over the pond, bubbles began to rise, splashing, and commotion."}
{"translation": "Water was splashing, jostling the cups, hastily scurrying in all directions were the water-measuring beetles, and finally, in the mysterious depths, a golden glow began to flicker."}
{"translation": "It was impossible to understand what it was until the father pulled out a heavy carp from the tangled grass."}
{"translation": "He was lying on his side, breathing heavily and moving his fins."}
{"translation": "From his scales emanated a wonderful smell of the underwater kingdom."}
{"translation": "Yasha thought about himself for seconds."}
{"translation": "We knew that it took seven minutes to walk from Sturdza Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium."}
{"translation": "In the sanatorium behind high walls and iron gates, we always felt completely safe."}
{"translation": "Especially if they didn't light the stove."}
{"translation": "As we were passing by the gate, Yasha stumbled."}
{"translation": "Afterwards, when we recalled the incident in Sturdza Lane, Yasha insisted that whenever you want to do something in the best possible way, you should always start with something trivial."}
{"translation": "I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything."}
{"translation": "But I kept silent, not to upset Yasha."}
{"translation": "We were crawling through the alley."}
{"translation": "I said that we should go along the side where the gap is, not stopping short of it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass through the gap."}
{"translation": "The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically accurate."}
{"translation": "If there are people in the entrance, they may not notice us."}
{"translation": "If we walk on the opposite side of the alley, they may notice us from afar."}
{"translation": "I calculated that in the last case, we will be going against a dangerous current, or rather, we will be in plain sight of the people who have taken cover in the underpass, for five times longer."}
{"translation": "And therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed."}
{"translation": "I woke up in the morning to the hot sun beating on the white walls."}
{"translation": "The red and yellow marigolds swayed in the open window."}
{"translation": "Together with them, I peered into the room where a nasturtium flower was sitting; a furry bee was sitting on it."}
{"translation": "I, frozen, watched as she angrily struggled and extricated herself from the tight flower."}
{"translation": "The bright streams flowed endlessly, reflected in the gentle waves of the river."}
{"translation": "The river murmured here, right next to us."}
