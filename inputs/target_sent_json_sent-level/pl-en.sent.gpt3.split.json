{"translation": "He looks at the family, all girls, as the mother with a child at her breast clumsily gets down from the cart and the driver hurries her, as the cart has to go back to the suburbs to pick up more people."}
{"translation": "The bundle she had on her back falls and a few faded rags and a single string of small, darkened beads spill out of it."}
{"translation": "The woman collects them embarrassedly, as if she had just revealed her most inaccessible secrets to the world."}
{"translation": "Deymova passed by and suddenly a boy, perhaps six or seven years old, ran up to her, looking at her with smiling eyes, very pleased with himself, and said: \"Praise be to Jesus Christ!\""}
{"translation": "She responds automatically, yet solemnly: \"Forever and ever, amen."}
{"translation": "And she clutches her heart and tears start to well up in her eyes."}
{"translation": "She kneels down beside the boy, takes him by the wrists, and he looks at her with eyes full of tears, still smiling, a little rascal."}
{"translation": "The first buildings suddenly and unexpectedly loomed before them."}
{"translation": "The fog seems to distort the sense of distance, for even Kasia is surprised by it."}
{"translation": "Suddenly it leapt, jerking the shaft, and if it hadn't been for Roszek's firm reaction and his whip, it would have overturned the cart."}
{"translation": "Maybe it was the sparks that flew out of the fireplace that scared Kasia, or the unease of the horses waiting to be shod."}
{"translation": "A faint smell of sweetness permeates every item on display for sale."}
{"translation": "You can eat it like bread."}
{"translation": "In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babi\u0144ce, there are a few small breweries, and it is from there that the appetizing smell spreads throughout the area."}
{"translation": "Many stalls here sell beer, and the better shops have both vodka and mead in stock, mostly three-star."}
{"translation": "Wakszul the Jewish merchant's store offers wine, genuine Hungarian and genuine Rhine, and some slightly tart ones that are brought all the way from Wallachia."}
{"translation": "The most to be said would be about the Wolowski family, as it had grown to immense proportions."}
{"translation": "Almost all the branches of this family were ennobled, one with the Baw\u00f3\u0142 coat of arms, the other with the Na Kaskach coat of arms."}
{"translation": "Undoubtedly, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wo\u0142owski, the same one whom Father Chmielowski called Jeremiah, had made a great career."}
{"translation": "He was born in 1786 in Br\u00fcnn and raised in Offenbach, and he became one of the best lawyers and legal experts of that time."}
{"translation": "Interestingly, when a motion was introduced in the Sejm to grant Polish citizenship to Jews, Franciszek, as a deputy, argued in his passionate speech that it was not yet time for such a step."}
{"translation": "First, the Polish nation must fight for its independence, and then it will be time for social reforms."}
{"translation": "All the Offenbach neophytes were buried in the city cemetery, which, however, began to interfere with the city's expansion plans and was abolished in 1866."}
{"translation": "The bones of the people buried there were gathered and respectfully laid to rest in another place."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the skull of Jacob Frank was taken out of the grave and, carefully described as the \"skull of a Jewish patriarch\", it ended up in the hands of the Offenbach city historian."}
{"translation": "Many years later, under unknown circumstances, it ended up in Berlin, where it was subjected to detailed measurements and tests and declared an example of Jewish racial inferiority."}
{"translation": "After the war it disappeared without a trace perhaps destroyed by the ravages of war, scattered into dust, or still lying in the underground storage of some museum."}
{"translation": "After Jacob's death, a great peace descended upon me."}
{"translation": "My main occupation became studying the Merkava, and on top of that there were our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski since we were living in the same room, which brought us closer."}
{"translation": "I also told Jeruchim about Chai Szor that she was the only woman I could love and that I had loved her since that beautiful moment when I got her for one night, when I came to Rohatyn with news about Jakub."}
{"translation": "But above all, I loved Jacob."}
{"translation": "They had been in Ivani since April."}
{"translation": "If it weren't for the kind people of Iwa, we would have surely perished from hunger."}
{"translation": "Ivan had saved their lives and health, Beyla was feeling better now and no longer coughed so much."}
{"translation": "Srol believes that when they are baptized, they will be as well off as Christians."}
{"translation": "They would get a piece of land, Bejla would have vegetables in the garden and he, Srol, would weave kilims, because he knew how to do it well."}
{"translation": "When they get old and marry off their daughters, they will take them in."}
{"translation": "These were all his dreams."}
{"translation": "\"Look, sir, Kaska doesn't want to go,\" Roszko said gloomily as the carriage stopped."}
{"translation": "Roszko got off the donkey and made several grand farewells."}
{"translation": "Then he leaned forward and peered into the fog, as if looking into water."}
{"translation": "Underneath his festive red, albeit slightly faded, coat came out a shirt."}
{"translation": "\"I don't know where to go,\" she says."}
{"translation": "\"You don't know?"}
{"translation": "But we're already on the Rohatyn path,\" the priest said in surprise."}
{"translation": "Yet still!"}
{"translation": "He gets out of the carriage and follows the servant, they circle the carriage helplessly, straining their eyes in the whiteness."}
{"translation": "They think they see something, but eyes that can't latch onto anything start playing tricks on them."}
{"translation": "How could something like this have happened to them!"}
{"translation": "It's like getting lost in your own pocket."}
{"translation": "\"Shh!\" the priest suddenly said, raising his finger and listening intently."}
{"translation": "And indeed, from somewhere to the left, from the mists, a faint sound of water could be heard."}
{"translation": "\"Let's follow this noise."}
{"translation": "It is water that flows,\" the priest decides."}
{"translation": "Soon the priest relaxes in the rocking chair, stretches out his legs and lets his eyes wander across the sea of fog."}
{"translation": "He immediately fell into a travelling reverie, for it is in motion that man does his best thinking."}
{"translation": "Slowly, reluctantly, the mechanism of his mind was coming to life, surprising cogs and gears setting the wheels in motion, just like the clock that stands in his presbytery hallway, purchased in Lviv; he paid dearly for it."}
{"translation": "In a moment, the bim-bom will sound."}
{"translation": "He began to wonder if the world had not come from such a fog."}
{"translation": "The Jewish historian Josephus Flavius maintains that the world was created in the autumn, during the autumn equinox."}
{"translation": "One could assume so, for in paradise there were fruits; since the apple was hanging on the tree, it must have been autumn."}
{"translation": "There is some truth to this."}
{"translation": "But then another thought came to his mind:"}
{"translation": "What kind of argument is that?"}
{"translation": "Couldn't an all-powerful"}
{"translation": "God create extra-special fruits at any time of the year?"}
{"translation": "When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join the stream of pedestrians, horsemen and all kinds of carts that emerge from the fog, like figures made from bread dough for Christmas."}
{"translation": "It's Wednesday, the market in Rohatyn, and the peasants' carts are loaded with sacks of grain, cages of poultry, and all manner of agricultural produce."}
{"translation": "Between them, briskly marching, were traders with every possible kind of merchandise their stalls, now cleverly folded, could be carried on their backs like a pack-saddle, and in a moment they would become tables full of colorful fabrics, wooden toys, eggs bought from the villages at a quarter of the price."}
{"translation": "The peasants also take goats and cows to sell the animals, frightened by the commotion, are stuck in puddles."}
{"translation": "A speeding cart covered with a tattered tarp passes them, full of noisy Jews who had come from all around to Rohatyn for the market, and behind them a rich carriage struggles its way through the fog and the throng on the road, unable to maintain its dignity\u2014the bright lacquered doors are black with mud, and the coachman's face in his blue cape looks dazed, he had not expected such a commotion and now he is desperately searching for an opportunity to turn off this devilish road."}
