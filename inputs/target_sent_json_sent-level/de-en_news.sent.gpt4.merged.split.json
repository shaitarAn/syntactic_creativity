{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a wealth of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "She represented an opportunity for me to discover new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century."}
{"translation": "Century ago:"}
{"translation": "To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying emotions."}
{"translation": "Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that one can indeed create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to obtain ammunition, but also possesses far more sophisticated and profound content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit contributes to changing your attitude in this regard."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition."}
{"translation": "Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to yet discover everything."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles previously considered immutable."}

{"translation": "Nothing slips anymore."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again immediately."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's too big for under 1 year."}
{"translation": "The product itself is quite okay, however not under one year."}
{"translation": "Because the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth."}

{"translation": "Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his few existing teeth."}
{"translation": "And when he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, it goes back."}
{"translation": "I suppose I allowed myself to be dazzled by the partly gushing reviews here."}
{"translation": "I would like to preface by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use."}
{"translation": "A very large one (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you on the go."}

{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, came the disillusionment:"}
{"translation": "The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, one can't deny that."}
{"translation": "But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices ."}
{"translation": "People, that's simply not true!"}
{"translation": "I was really hoping that it was so, but there's absolutely no way it is."}
{"translation": "The padded walls are significantly thinner and do not provide the same protection as my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more flimsy."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Even the zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly high quality."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back."}
{"translation": "If I invest in equipment costing several thousand euros, unfortunately, I also have to spend money on a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "Quality apparently does have its price here."}
{"translation": "For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's not like the decision was difficult for me either."}
{"translation": "When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back."}
{"translation": "What I really liked is the color inside."}
{"translation": "Here, one can certainly find their things much faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, this backpack is certainly a great thing."}
{"translation": "However, I will be returning mine."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed by the third part."}
{"translation": "So far, I liked the Electricity series by E. L."}
{"translation": "Todd the best, but this book changed my opinion."}
{"translation": "I found the first two books to be very powerful and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part."}
{"translation": "In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything, and then acts like a small child and withdraws during every argument?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't manage without him and that he himself had heard it."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "I will read the fourth part anyway and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring back more tension into the story."}
{"translation": "God Human destroys everything, appreciates nothing and learns nothing!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not as bad as many people say."}
{"translation": "Sure, of course the story is totally contrived, and repeatedly designed according to the same blueprint."}
{"translation": "If you've seen the beginning, you know what the ending is."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and never learn!"}
{"translation": "And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "Therefore, Jurassic World:"}
{"translation": "The Fallen Kingdom is really well made."}
{"translation": "It's just a shame that people simply don't get the message behind the movie, despite it being a mainstream film."}
{"translation": "We consistently destroy animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves as well."}
{"translation": "Empathy for the environment and living beings: nonexistent."}
{"translation": "4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise it could have been 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Still well-made popcorn cinema."}
{"translation": "a quiet, sensitive movie"}
{"translation": "Some expect a movie like 8 Mile here."}
{"translation": "This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't aim to be one either."}

{"translation": "Terrible stench and poor result!"}
{"translation": "I dyed my blonde hair to a chocolate brown in October using an intensive tint, and in February/March I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I have used the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time, I immediately noticed that it smells terribly!"}
{"translation": "However, there was still not too bad a result, it turned out to be approximately chestnut brown (a bit darker)."}
{"translation": "Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it one more time, as the instructions also suggested for unsatisfactory results."}
{"translation": "This time it was a complete waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It made no difference, my hair looked the same as with the first attempt."}
{"translation": "The very worst part was, it still stunk for weeks after the application."}
{"translation": "No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away."}

{"translation": "The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets."}
{"translation": "Highly recommended."}
{"translation": "After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following severe defects which I find very disturbing:"}
{"translation": "1) Over time, the case has problems \"connecting\" with the phone."}
{"translation": "This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the \"Power On/Off\" button for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "When you remove the cell phone from its case and reinstall it, you can solve the problem in 70% of cases."}
{"translation": "However, this creates a new defect."}
{"translation": "2) Due to frequently removing and reinserting the phone into the case, the cover has worn out so much that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "Although these are not many major defects, I believe that a battery case should function flawlessly, and therefore, for the cost of 30\u20ac, I am very disappointed with the product."}
{"translation": "This is especially because I have only been using it for three months."}
{"translation": "Way too expensive, too thin, and disappointing."}
{"translation": "I don't know how all these good reviews came about."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift in a slightly smaller form from any optician."}
{"translation": "The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better."}
{"translation": "I expected much more from these cloths, they are indeed very, very thin."}
{"translation": "Since I've used it, I unfortunately can't exchange it anymore."}
{"translation": "I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my point of view."}
{"translation": "The price for these wipes is far too high, one should not pay more than 2 Euros."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response."}
{"translation": "I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller complimentary speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "In general, the Onforu works great, it's waterproof (already fell into the shower), produces bass as bass should be, Bluetooth works great."}
{"translation": "Of course you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off."}
{"translation": "It can play sound very loud."}
{"translation": ".. yes."}
{"translation": "What I critically see is the frequency response of this small speaker."}
{"translation": "As said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the song almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just barely audible."}
{"translation": "My old speaker may not have reproduced bass sound well, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have to deduct a star for this."}
{"translation": "I just expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "In a few places, the paint had chipped off and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint also came off in some places."}
{"translation": "We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts, but how if both dressers were damaged."}
{"translation": "Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded us the money."}
{"translation": "A praise for Amazon"}
{"translation": "Better to spend a bit more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered which one has to glue together themselves."}
{"translation": "The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no further protection."}
{"translation": "Since the mailman crammed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged."}
{"translation": "I did not complain because I urgently needed this product."}
{"translation": "Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive does not dry (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one must be very careful that everything does not stick together."}
{"translation": "The stencils are partially not cut out completely."}
{"translation": "For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "Not dissatisfied."}
{"translation": "The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not very clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic closures + Beautiful appearance + Stable when assembled + Shelf can be positioned as desired"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit in order to be truly satisfied."}
{"translation": "Moreover, I find it a bit too expensive for that."}
{"translation": "I like the taste of the coffee."}
{"translation": ".. but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive)."}
{"translation": "In that respect, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a one star deduction for me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and scores full points soon."}
{"translation": "Gets on my nerves"}
{"translation": "The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "But: the natural sounds are awful, and extremely loud at that."}
{"translation": "I couldn't turn them down either."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, it would instantly knock me out of bed."}
{"translation": "In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning."}
{"translation": "I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately, you cannot dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time do not need to be reset in case of a power outage."}
{"translation": "But returned for the aforementioned reasons."}
{"translation": "Light superb, processing insufficient."}
{"translation": "I have replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "There was also nothing in the box."}
{"translation": "Amazon probably would have resolved this graciously and quickly, but I only noticed it after the return deadline."}
{"translation": "So I see that as my mistake and live with it."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated."}
{"translation": "The light color tends more towards cool white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for the hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc."}
{"translation": "For living spaces, I personally would opt for warmer light."}
{"translation": "Definitely comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb."}
{"translation": "Other lamps can do the same, however, and perhaps I will also receive intact specimens according to the order there."}
{"translation": "If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating."}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first glance."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive."}
{"translation": "I've spent a long time debating whether to order this set or not."}
{"translation": "The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand."}
{"translation": "All the utensils have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up."}
{"translation": "The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots, and is particularly practical to use on coated pans."}
{"translation": "They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 \u2109."}
{"translation": "They also do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly."}
{"translation": "However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But shortly after wiping, they're gone."}
{"translation": "Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend."}
{"translation": "B-Grade Goods"}
{"translation": "Sold as New"}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping simply top-notch."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked."}
{"translation": "During this, we found out that the part had already been installed once before."}
{"translation": "We have had to identify considerable scratches and abrasions on all parts on Mondays."}
{"translation": "The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only now did we see that there are also scratch marks / streaks visible on the chrome-plated faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This item has probably already been delivered and returned."}
{"translation": "We are keeping this faucet and installing it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion;"}
{"translation": "We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather prefer to spend a bit more at the hardware store where we get decent merchandise."}
{"translation": "I just find it sad that customers are being cheated like this!!!"}
{"translation": "The product itself is great, but unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months."}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very straightforward, and the radio range is also very good, with no problems at all with transmission from inside to outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after approximately."}
{"translation": "After half a year of use, the device that measures values outside seems to be broken."}
{"translation": "It seems that the thermometer is still intact, it continues to display plausible values."}
{"translation": "The hygrometer, on the other hand, appears to be broken, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values for the outdoor humidity."}
{"translation": "That is very unfortunate, since the device was installed outdoors in a protected location and also the reason why I only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Powerful mower with weak collection bag."}
{"translation": "Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service was as always excellent with initiating a replacement delivery."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression."}
{"translation": "The engine is powerful and it results in a nice cut image."}
{"translation": "The volume is not exactly impressively low, but it's okay."}
{"translation": "The big downside is unfortunately the catch basket."}
{"translation": "For one, it is made of hard plastic only at the top and bottom, with fabric in between."}
{"translation": "If you only briefly put it down when it's full, of course it gets compressed and parts of the content fall out."}
{"translation": "However, what is worse is that the supposedly practical fill-level indicator already shows red when the catch basket is only half full."}
{"translation": "That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cut material from then on."}
{"translation": "Always emptying the basket on a large lawn area when it is only half full cannot be the solution."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "Essentially a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catcher renders it useless for me."}
{"translation": "Good device for surveillance"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated through the app."}
{"translation": "The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if needed."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed one to three times a day (adjustable) in the app."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons, I am only giving 4 stars."}
{"translation": "This device loses its network connection every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even when placed near the router."}
{"translation": "You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it will reconnect."}
{"translation": "This should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed correctly."}
{"translation": "The right rear locking screw is fully tightened yet the hotbed is still too high, and on the front right, the screw basically falls out as it's not tightened at all even though the hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The rods that hold the car are straight, as is the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what can be done, because as it is, it's impossible to print anything."}
{"translation": "Regarding the setup:"}
{"translation": "The assembly was quite trouble-free, one could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous."}
{"translation": "I have already contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, returning it is no longer possible."}
{"translation": "Had expected a bit more."}
{"translation": "Robust and precise, I am positively surprised."}
{"translation": "My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one."}
{"translation": "This one appears to be very robust and is just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "Included are two batteries, so you can start right away."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the slider is simple, but it fully serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give full points for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "From me, there is a clear buying recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell"}
{"translation": "I bought the bracelet and haven't worn it yet, as it emits a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "To this day, this smell is not gone, even though it has been constantly \"aired out."}
{"translation": "After return was no longer possible, I disposed of it."}
{"translation": "Advise against buying"}
{"translation": "Okay for the price"}
{"translation": "The stars and spheres on this chain are personally a bit too large for me, making it appear quite bulky."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain is overall very simply constructed, so I've already torn open the clasp twice."}
{"translation": "So far, I have been able to repair it over and over again, but I think that this will not last/hold up for long."}
{"translation": "But for the low price, you simply can't really expect anything of high quality."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry."}
{"translation": "One simply needs to pull the end through the mouth, it cannot open, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more pliable."}
{"translation": "Just note: anyone who has something magnetic on their arm:"}
{"translation": "The clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, junk!"}
{"translation": "I was disappointed right after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was fine."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "It only connects after some fiddling."}
{"translation": ".. if one follows the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I had removed a battery from the base station and inserted a new one, did the transmitters finally connect."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy about this didn't last long, because just after one hour the connection was lost again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Also, the display of the three stations was very different!"}
{"translation": "All in all, it's not usable for me like this!"}
{"translation": "The thing went back!"}
{"translation": "Would certainly advise against a purchase, it only brings trouble!"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Transport damage Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3. 5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted away."}
{"translation": "I only bought them again for one reason, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the fault in the previous pump was a production error and that the current pump will last a bit longer in its service."}
{"translation": "The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in the future, instead of just using a thin-walled box."}
{"translation": "I kept the pump anyway, as described above, because I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic casing did not affect its performance."}
{"translation": "Could have been thought through better."}
{"translation": "Since I frequently deal with many different keys, I thought that having an organizer would be more pleasant than always walking around with a huge bunch of keys."}
{"translation": "At first, everything went quite well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws had to be tightened frequently."}
{"translation": "Nice that it also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin."}
{"translation": "I could not find a suitable flathead screwdriver that would not have immediately ruined the entire screw."}
{"translation": "Now, to get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes through the various parts."}
{"translation": "Once you've screwed everything together, you may need pliers to take it all apart again."}
{"translation": "Eventually, the screw broke off in the thread during my third assembly and rendered the whole thing useless."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all, then only once for all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite match the stated measurements."}
{"translation": "Smooth-running zippers, the material seems robust and all of this in featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will be able to actually judge the product only after its first use."}
{"translation": "I can already tell you in advance that the height is lower than stated."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't really imagine being able to do everything there, for example."}
{"translation": "Packing for a three-week vacation."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller pouches/bags."}
{"translation": "Not high-quality craftsmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags, doesn't bother me personally."}
{"translation": "So-so"}
{"translation": "So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Exchanged."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "So I could have thrown the money directly into the trash can as well."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle."}
{"translation": "I could not discern an improvement in sound with my very high-quality turntable."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Included were two black cables."}
{"translation": "The battery life lasts a very long time."}
{"translation": "Definitely completely sufficient sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also kept very low."}
{"translation": "Purchase recommendation in this price range."}
{"translation": "stylish dress"}
{"translation": "Very beautiful dress, which is well wearable for the most diverse occasions."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wish that the neckline wasn't so plunging, and the sleeves could also use a bit more fabric (if one doesn't have quite as slim upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Stay away."}
{"translation": "It can't get any worse."}
{"translation": "I really and sincerely did not expect that such garbage is sold nowadays."}
{"translation": "The drive is operating on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized to the maximum unreliably."}
{"translation": "The discs need to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes rattling noises like those you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives."}
{"translation": "After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it's not going to work anymore, or the disc will finally be recognized."}
{"translation": "Then you absolutely must not press pause or skip to another chapter or change the language during the movie, or do anything else at all."}
{"translation": "This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze."}
{"translation": "In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included."}
{"translation": "If one buys PowerDVD or something similar at an additional cost, the price of this drive doubles."}
{"translation": "Does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First and foremost, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually a deception because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know that at the time of purchase, which is why I was a bit disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly would not have bought this unwieldy lump with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably."}
{"translation": "And because of the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around, as it would with a regular extension cord."}
{"translation": "So not really a bad purchase, but my enthusiasm is quite limited :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but mighty!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and also connect a display."}
{"translation": "With iOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters, which I also had to send back, unfortunately could not do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to the tablet and the HDMI is connected to the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Sound is delivered via HDMI."}
{"translation": "What else do I use my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder."}
{"translation": "This doesn't fit with the adapter with my case."}
{"translation": "Well, it holds securely and has contact, so. .."}
{"translation": "All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "Moreover, the whole thing is very small and sturdily made of a piece of aluminum."}
{"translation": "Price performance fits."}
{"translation": "Plenty of performance"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Has been running without problems for months."}
{"translation": "It's not exactly easy or quiet, but it delivers a lot of power."}
{"translation": "I find the middle setting of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool, so I am always on level 2."}
{"translation": "It has already fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived it well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competitor products sometimes do look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good"}
{"translation": "The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression."}
{"translation": "During operation, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and they can be recommended without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised that in live mode, the location tracking seems to be accurate to 0. 5 meters."}
{"translation": "In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does like to jump a few meters occasionally, which however is not bothersome."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again anytime."}
{"translation": "However, what would be great is a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "Currently, it lasts about 1. 5 days."}
{"translation": "Here would be a great solution that could last 7-14 days."}
{"translation": "Although there is an XL version, unfortunately it's too large for our taste."}
{"translation": "We wouldn't need the battery to last that long, and we also find changing it daily to be inconvenient."}
{"translation": "One should engage with the dog, not with its collar :-)."}
{"translation": "The app also worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks of trash"}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and seem to be comfortable too."}
{"translation": "However, the lifespan is increasingly decreasing."}
{"translation": "Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used."}
{"translation": "With the last pair, it was the same in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be sufficient for the class."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, these here appear to be poorly made at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there seems to be no noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the edges are poorly made and the heel strap is rather loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones."}
{"translation": "I'm excited!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical."}
{"translation": "However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck."}
{"translation": "The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump."}
{"translation": "About the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I have placed it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) on a trial basis."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there is some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it off and hope that this doesn't reappear."}
{"translation": "A lying test was conducted immediately in the inflated state."}
{"translation": "It's comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress cannot replace one's own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits wonderfully into my car."}
{"translation": "Before, we removed the seats from the back."}
{"translation": "Thus, it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "The Air Pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has various adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint)."}
{"translation": "Since my friend is skilled in crafts, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the excellent piece worked superbly and inflated the mattress in no time at all."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very excited about the mattress."}
{"translation": "I'm looking forward to the acid test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it doesn't lose air and also lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "Similarly, that the mold does not reappear."}
{"translation": "After the test, I can definitely recommend them already."}
{"translation": "If I should have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars."}
{"translation": "1. For fast shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar tore open across several doors on day 1 due to sloppy craftsmanship."}
{"translation": "On the 21st door, there were no little doors left, and I had to more or less allow my son that he can accordingly also take out the remaining parts, since they practically already fell out towards him."}
{"translation": "The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to install the parts."}
{"translation": "After the car is fully assembled, parts come off while playing."}
{"translation": "(Mainly the windshield."}
{"translation": "Personally, I would not buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."}
{"translation": "Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am fascinated by the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it."}
{"translation": "It flies very well indoors and for 5 minutes."}
{"translation": "Flight times are usually completely sufficient."}
{"translation": "I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly given the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether on tile or carpet, are not a problem."}
{"translation": "Polite contact for any questions."}
{"translation": "Game is okay but can only be played forcibly through Steam."}
{"translation": "I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it's not a game CD, but only a code that can be used to download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be fine so far, but one is forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is an outrage."}
{"translation": "Ever since then, the computer has been constantly freezing, which would certainly not be the case with a clean installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life."}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the watch."}
{"translation": "Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without problems."}
{"translation": "The operation worked well."}
{"translation": ".. and yet I'm sending it back."}
{"translation": "The big catch: the battery and its runtime."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, just laid on the shelf overnight and in the morning 11% less battery despite not being used."}
{"translation": "If many messages came during the day, the battery was already dead by noon/early afternoon and then you can't even tell the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore, not usable for me."}
{"translation": "Very unfortunate."}
{"translation": "Noble case with limitations"}
{"translation": "For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case."}
