{"translation": "The peasants also keep goats and cows for sale the animals, terrified by the noise, stop in the puddles."}
{"translation": "They are passed by a speeding cart covered with a tarp with holes, full of noisy Jews who come to the fair in Rohatyn from all over the area, and behind them a rich carriage breaks through, which in the fog and crowded road it is difficult to maintain its dignity the bright lacquered doors are black with mud, and the coachman's face in the blue cloak seems dim, he obviously didn't expect such a commotion, and now he's desperately looking for an opportunity to get off this devilish road."}
