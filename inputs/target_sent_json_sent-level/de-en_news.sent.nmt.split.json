{"translation": "The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor."}
{"translation": "This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tanker."}
{"translation": "The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes."}
{"translation": "In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots."}
{"translation": "The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses."}
{"translation": "In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals."}
{"translation": "These cannot attack the player tank."}
{"translation": "Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO."}
{"translation": "The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation."}
{"translation": "These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation sequence, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test procedure."}
{"translation": "The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function."}
{"translation": "4. Gameplay"}
{"translation": "The game is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed."}
{"translation": "The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible."}
{"translation": "If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over."}
{"translation": "The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen."}
{"translation": "The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit."}
{"translation": "A hint can be, for example:"}
{"translation": "OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT."}
{"translation": "In addition, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, a dot becomes visible that represents the enemy position."}
{"translation": "The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below."}
{"translation": "If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRING RANGE is displayed in the upper left hint display at the same time."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield."}
{"translation": "These are safe missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank."}
{"translation": "The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar."}
{"translation": "The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles."}
{"translation": "UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the enemy tank."}
{"translation": "A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points."}
{"translation": "If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank."}
{"translation": "A Super Tank drives and spins twice as fast as the Player Tank or an enemy slow-moving tank."}
{"translation": "Several possibilities give the stander the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design."}

{"translation": "5. Initial input for maximum results"}
{"translation": "If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum results, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table at the end of the game."}
{"translation": "The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button is pressed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the highest results is deleted."}
{"translation": "When RESET is performed, the top ten (10) scores are obtained with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players."}
{"translation": "Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank icon, followed by the player's initials."}
{"translation": "If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write in dashes."}
{"translation": "After that, the device switches back to the attraction gameplay."}
{"translation": "ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT"}

{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to create video games was sparked in me by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "For me, it was an opportunity to open up new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual."}
{"translation": "To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "I had the dull feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on \"action\" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits feelings."}
{"translation": "Although this could of course have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just about fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has far more challenging and in-depth content."}
{"translation": "It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you're more skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your mindset."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition."}
{"translation": "Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us to question many of the principles previously considered incontrovertible."}
{"translation": "I'd be lucky if Fahrenheit much like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you doesn't leave you completely unscathed either."}
{"translation": "David Cage"}
{"translation": "THE README FILE"}
{"translation": "There is a ReadMe file on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM where you can view the license agreement and updated information about the game."}

{"translation": "BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater."}
{"translation": "Had oriented myself from the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L."}
{"translation": "Since it's supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size."}
{"translation": "In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips."}
{"translation": ".. in the rest I could swim."}
{"translation": "In addition, the lining material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere."}
{"translation": "It's just a shame."}
{"translation": "It will be sent back :/"}
{"translation": "Fast delivery and good workmanship"}
{"translation": "The jacket makes a great impression."}
{"translation": "We were surprised by the good workmanship."}
{"translation": "You can wear them well from both sides."}
{"translation": "We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled."}
{"translation": "She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year."}
{"translation": "We can recommend an order."}
{"translation": "Robust quality"}
{"translation": "I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I mismeasured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit."}
{"translation": "But that's my mistake."}
{"translation": "Then I slightly changed something to make it fit."}
{"translation": "The overlay looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges."}
{"translation": "You can use the groove or the whole surface."}
{"translation": "Worked without any problems."}
{"translation": "Nothing slips anymore."}
{"translation": "I would buy again immediately."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year"}
{"translation": "The product itself is okay, but not less than a year."}
{"translation": "Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth."}
{"translation": "We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him because of the size."}
{"translation": "Now, at 12 months, we have picked him out again and he can use it."}
{"translation": "Hasn't been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth."}
{"translation": "And if he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back"}
{"translation": "I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews."}
{"translation": "First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use."}
{"translation": "A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you."}
{"translation": "Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2. 8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement."}
{"translation": "At Prime Day"}
{"translation": "I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance."}
{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed:"}
{"translation": "The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that."}
{"translation": "But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices ."}
{"translation": "Guys, that's just not true!"}
{"translation": "I was really hoping that it would be so, but there is really no question of that."}
{"translation": "The upholstered walls are much thinner and don't offer as much protection as my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more unstable."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to that of my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality."}
{"translation": "That's why I decided for myself that the backpack would go back."}
{"translation": "If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money on a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "Quality apparently has its price here."}
{"translation": "For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's not that the decision was difficult for me."}
{"translation": "When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back."}
{"translation": "What I liked is the color inside."}
{"translation": "Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed with the third part"}
{"translation": "So far, I had liked the electrics series by E. L. Todd best, but my opinion has been revised with this book."}
{"translation": "I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part."}
{"translation": "The part is about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time and I found it unnecessarily drawn-out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admitting everything to herself and then being like a little child in every argument and grimacing?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he heard it himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I was hoping that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring more suspense back into the story."}
{"translation": "Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not as bad as many write."}
{"translation": "Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and always designed according to the same scheme."}
{"translation": "When you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn!"}
{"translation": "And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "How many times have I just thought about the movie (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer):"}
{"translation": "Oh my God, the poor animals, they often bring tears to your eyes."}
{"translation": "That's why Jurassic World:"}
{"translation": "The Fallen Kingdom is really well done."}
{"translation": "It's just a shame that people just can't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film."}
{"translation": "We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and us."}
{"translation": "Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance!"}
{"translation": "Empathy for the environment and living beings :None."}
{"translation": "4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been 5 stars in it."}
{"translation": "Still, well-made popcorn cinema."}
{"translation": "a quiet, sensitive film"}
{"translation": "Some expect a film \u00e0 la 8 Mile."}
{"translation": "This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be."}
{"translation": "This film is above all \"French\" it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be."}
{"translation": "Problematic"}
{"translation": "Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter."}
{"translation": "5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing."}
{"translation": "My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm!"}
{"translation": "Flatulence like never before!"}
{"translation": "After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day."}
{"translation": "Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger one full 5?"}
{"translation": "This is very, very strange!"}
{"translation": "terrible stench and low result!"}
{"translation": "I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I applied the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time I noticed that it stinks terribly!"}
{"translation": "However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a chestnut brown (slightly darker)."}
{"translation": "Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied."}
{"translation": "This time it was a waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like it did on the first try."}
{"translation": "Worst of all, it still stinked weeks after using it."}
{"translation": "No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away."}
{"translation": "Highly recommended"}
{"translation": "I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days."}
{"translation": "My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness."}
{"translation": "I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2."}
{"translation": "This also works in a very good way."}
{"translation": "I feel fitter and much more comfortable."}
{"translation": "I sleep better and get out of bed better."}
{"translation": "The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets."}
{"translation": "Absolutely recommended."}
{"translation": "Function not quite flawless!!"}
{"translation": "After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major flaws, which I find very annoying:"}
{"translation": "1) The case has problems \"connecting\" to the mobile phone over time."}
{"translation": "This means that it is no longer charged even though you have pressed the \"Power On/Off\" button for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "If you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but it creates a new defect."}
{"translation": "2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "These are not many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the cost of 30\u20ac, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months."}
{"translation": "Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing"}
{"translation": "I don't know how all these good reviews come about."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift."}
{"translation": "The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better."}
{"translation": "I expected a lot more from these scarves, it's also really very, very thin."}
{"translation": "Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side, the price for these cloths is far exaggerated, more than 2 euros should not be given."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response"}
{"translation": "I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great."}
{"translation": "Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off."}
{"translation": "It can reproduce sound very loudly."}
{"translation": ".. yes."}
{"translation": ". what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker."}
{"translation": "As I said, bass is rendered as bass and is not converted to a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough."}
{"translation": "My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were reproduced quite naturally in volume."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying."}
{"translation": "That's why I have to deduct one star."}
{"translation": "I expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "Very bad"}
{"translation": "In a few places the paint was chipped and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places."}
{"translation": "We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers was damaged."}
{"translation": "Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us."}
{"translation": "A PRAISE to Amazon"}
{"translation": "Better to spend a little more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself."}
{"translation": "The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no further protection."}
{"translation": "Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged."}
{"translation": "I didn't find fault with it, as I desperately needed this product."}
{"translation": "The included adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly like chewing gum which does not harden."}
{"translation": "Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together."}
{"translation": "Some of the stencils are incompletely punched out."}
{"translation": "It's ok for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "I'm not dissatisfied."}
{"translation": "The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic clasp + beautiful look + stable when it is set up + shelf can be positioned as desired"}
{"translation": "Doors slam with magnets (maybe you can compensate for it with rubber knobs) some unclean spots"}
{"translation": "supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and have them since there was no trophy in the house, glued with craft glue) the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (wrapped it with some paper and balanced)"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars,  Because you have to make everything fit in order to be really satisfied."}
{"translation": "Besides, I think it's a bit too expensive for that."}
{"translation": "The coffee tastes good to me. .."}
{"translation": ". but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive)."}
{"translation": "In this respect, I would have given 5*."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't run through evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed see photo) means a star deduction for me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon."}
{"translation": "Gets on my nerves"}
{"translation": "The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at that."}
{"translation": "I couldn't turn it down either."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed."}
{"translation": "In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall by hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow."}
{"translation": "However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me."}
{"translation": "I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure."}
{"translation": "But went back for the reasons mentioned."}
{"translation": "Light great, workmanship insufficient"}
{"translation": "I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point. .."}
{"translation": "There was nothing in the box either."}
{"translation": "\"Pay 6 get 4\" is not a good deal."}
{"translation": "I'm sure Amazon would have arranged this quickly and accommodatingly, but I didn't find out until after the return period."}
{"translation": "So I see this as my mistake and live with it."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs so far the only reason for two star deduction."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated."}
{"translation": "The light color tends to go in the direction of cool white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room, etc."}
{"translation": "For living spaces, I would personally go for warmer light."}
{"translation": "Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb."}
{"translation": "However, other lamps can also do this and I may also get intact copies there according to the order."}
{"translation": "If my review is a help, I would be happy to receive a positive review."}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look."}
{"translation": "Yes, positively."}
{"translation": "I've been thinking for a long time whether I should order this set or not."}
{"translation": "The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand."}
{"translation": "**The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them **"}
{"translation": "The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating."}
{"translation": "**They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440\u00b0F."}
{"translation": "**They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly."}
{"translation": "**However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But just after swiping and they're gone."}
{"translation": "Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend"}
{"translation": "B-stock sold as new"}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping simply great."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts."}
{"translation": "We found out that the part had already been installed."}
{"translation": "We have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts."}
{"translation": "The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This part has probably already been delivered and returned."}
{"translation": "We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion;"}
{"translation": "Never again do we order such goods via Amazon, but prefer to spend a little more in the hardware store, where we get decent goods."}
{"translation": "I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like this!!"}
{"translation": "Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months"}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here."}
{"translation": "The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside humidity are always displayed."}
{"translation": "This is a pity, because the device was attached to the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Strong mower with a weak grass collector"}
{"translation": "Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still driving through the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression."}
{"translation": "The engine is strong and it results in a nice cutting pattern."}
{"translation": "The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the big drawback is the catcher."}
{"translation": "On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between."}
{"translation": "If you put it down for a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out."}
{"translation": "What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red even when the grass collector is half full."}
{"translation": "That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on."}
{"translation": "Emptying the basket of a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass collector makes it unusable for me."}
{"translation": "Good device for monitoring"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated via the app."}
{"translation": "The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save the battery."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars."}
{"translation": "The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly."}
{"translation": "One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls."}
{"translation": "This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router."}
{"translation": "You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects."}
{"translation": "This should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm if the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "The alarm sound could be a little louder."}
{"translation": "3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to level the hotbed properly."}
{"translation": "The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the screw falls out at the front right, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The poles that hold the trolley are straight, as is the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it's impossible to print something out that way."}
{"translation": "About the construction:"}
{"translation": "The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to lay them again several times, which is very strenuous."}
{"translation": "I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back."}
{"translation": "Was expecting a little more."}
{"translation": "Robust and precise I am pleasantly surprised"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one."}
{"translation": "This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "Two batteries are included, so you can get started right away."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give full marks for it and I think it lasts at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "There is a clear buy recommendation from me and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell"}
{"translation": "I bought the bracelet and didn't wear it for the time being because it gives off a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly \"aired\"."}
{"translation": "After returning it is no longer possible, I disposed of it."}
{"translation": "Discount from purchase"}
{"translation": "Ok for the price"}
{"translation": "The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I think is quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain is very simple overall, so I have already torn open the clasp twice."}
{"translation": "So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that it won't last long."}
{"translation": "But for the low price you simply can't expect anything really high-quality."}
{"translation": "Very nice piece of jewelry"}
{"translation": "A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds!"}
{"translation": "You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I rubbed it with a little leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly."}
{"translation": "Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm:"}
{"translation": "The clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately junk!"}
{"translation": "I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was fine."}
{"translation": "Now for the function:"}
{"translation": "Connects only after some gimmicks."}
{"translation": "if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone, even though the transmitters were next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Also, the display of the three channels was very different!"}
{"translation": "All in all, not useful for me!"}
{"translation": "The thing went back!"}
{"translation": "In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it will only bring trouble!"}
{"translation": "Damage in transit"}
{"translation": "Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3. 5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off."}
{"translation": "I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the drain would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will do its job a little longer."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots broken."}
{"translation": "The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard box."}
{"translation": "I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance."}
{"translation": "Could have been thought through better."}
{"translation": "Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, everything went quite well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened."}
{"translation": "It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin."}
{"translation": "I didn't find a suitable flat-head screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw immediately."}
{"translation": "Now to get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It is nice that you can put the screw on different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again."}
{"translation": "Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill."}
{"translation": "In the end, the screw in the thread broke off on the third time I mounted it and thus the entire thing became unusable."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all, then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite correspond to the stated dimensions"}
{"translation": "Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I don't have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use."}
{"translation": "First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated."}
{"translation": "At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, e. g. For a three-week holiday."}
{"translation": "If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the case as before."}
{"translation": "It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags."}
{"translation": "Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally."}
{"translation": "I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok."}
{"translation": "So-so"}
{"translation": "So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas too."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Bartered."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle."}
{"translation": "I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "There were two black cables."}
{"translation": "Battery life is sufficient for a very long time."}
{"translation": "Definitely perfectly adequate sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also kept very low."}
{"translation": "Buy recommendation in this price range."}
{"translation": "chic dress"}
{"translation": "Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions."}
{"translation": "Price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning deal."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Hands off."}
{"translation": "It doesn't get any worse than that."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days."}
{"translation": "The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVD usually works, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably as possible."}
{"translation": "The discs have to be inserted several times, after which R\u00f6del makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives."}
{"translation": "After minutes you can either restart the computer because it doesn't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized."}
{"translation": "But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the film."}
{"translation": "This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze."}
{"translation": "In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included."}
{"translation": "If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles."}
{"translation": "Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port facing up is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a disdainful extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably."}
{"translation": "And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around like a normal extension cord."}
{"translation": "So it's not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but mighty!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display."}
{"translation": "With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Sound is delivered via HDMI."}
{"translation": "What else do I use my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder."}
{"translation": "With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter."}
{"translation": "Well, it also holds so safely and has contact from there."}
{"translation": "All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdily manufactured in an aluminum piece."}
{"translation": "Price performance fits."}
{"translation": "Lots of power"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Has been running for months without any problems."}
{"translation": "It's not exactly light or quiet, but it performs well."}
{"translation": "I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and am therefore always on level 2."}
{"translation": "Has also fallen several times on the tiled floor and has survived well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competing products like to look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good"}
{"translation": "The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression."}
{"translation": "In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great product with weak battery"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised, in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0. 5m."}
{"translation": "In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again at any time."}
{"translation": "What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "Currently it lasts about 1. 5 hours."}
{"translation": "A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great."}
{"translation": "There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so the battery wouldn't have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day."}
{"translation": "You should deal with the dog, not with his collar :-) ."}
{"translation": "The app also worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks of garbage"}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and also seem to be comfortable."}
{"translation": "However, the service life is decreasing more and more."}
{"translation": "Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used."}
{"translation": "With the last pair it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "Fits perfectly but original?"}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap on the heel is quite loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones."}
{"translation": "I'm curious!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first."}
{"translation": "However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance."}
{"translation": "The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery."}
{"translation": "About the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there is some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I've wiped it away and hope it doesn't reappear."}
{"translation": "When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly."}
{"translation": "It's easy to lie on and fits in perfectly with the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event it is pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits wonderfully into my car."}
{"translation": "Previously, we took out the seats in the back."}
{"translation": "Thus, it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "The air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has various adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint)."}
{"translation": "Since my boyfriend is a skilled craftsman, he was able to repair it and reassembled, the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in no time."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress."}
{"translation": "I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it does not lose air and also lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "Likewise, that he mold does not reappear."}
{"translation": "After the test, I can definitely recommend them."}
{"translation": "If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1."}
{"translation": "For fast shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ridiculous processing directly on day 1 over several doors."}
{"translation": "On the 21st door there were no more doors on it and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, because they were already coming towards him."}
{"translation": "The parts often come out of a mess, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts."}
{"translation": "After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing."}
{"translation": "(Most of all the windshield."}
{"translation": "This is also very difficult to reattach."}
{"translation": "In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"translation": "Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am thrilled with the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7 year old daughter flies with it."}
{"translation": "Indoors, it flies very well and the 5 min."}
{"translation": "Flight time is usually quite sufficient."}
{"translation": "I didn't expect hair to get stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem."}
{"translation": "If you have any questions, please contact us."}
{"translation": "Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam."}
{"translation": "When I bought it, I didn't see that it was not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game."}
{"translation": "That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery"}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the watch."}
{"translation": "Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems."}
{"translation": "Operation worked well."}
{"translation": "And yet I send them back."}
{"translation": "The big catch: the battery and its runtime."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, only on drm cabinet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use."}
{"translation": "If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time."}
{"translation": "Therefore, not usable for me."}
{"translation": "What a pity."}
{"translation": "Noble case with limitations"}
{"translation": "For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case."}
{"translation": "Most recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card."}
{"translation": "This is what the case offers here."}
{"translation": "If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit."}
{"translation": "One is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather case makes a sturdy impression and seems to be well made."}
{"translation": "She looks classy."}
{"translation": "In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only at the ports there are recesses."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, you can operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case."}
{"translation": "The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case."}
{"translation": "It doesn't even work on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO."}
{"translation": "Accessories such as the Galaxy Buds can only be charged when the case is off."}
{"translation": "Otherwise really chic and well made!"}
{"translation": "high-quality cover with bulletproof glass foil"}
{"translation": "Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11."}
{"translation": "The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty."}
{"translation": "A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio."}
{"translation": "This case gives the phone some grip."}
{"translation": "It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall, a good buy."}
