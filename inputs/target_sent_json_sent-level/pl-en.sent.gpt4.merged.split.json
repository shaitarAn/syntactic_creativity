{"translation": "He looks at the family, all little girls, a mother with a baby on her breast just clumsily getting off the cart and the carter is rushing her because the cart has to go back soon to pick up others in the suburbs."}
{"translation": "The bag she had on her back drops, and a few grayed rags spill out from it, along with a single string of beads, small and darkened."}
{"translation": "The woman collects them, embarrassed as if she had just revealed her most inaccessible secrets to the world."}
{"translation": "Deymowa passes her and suddenly a boy, perhaps six or seven years old, runs up to her."}
{"translation": "Looking at her with smiling eyes, very pleased with himself, he says: \"Praised be Jesus Christ!\"."}
{"translation": "She responds automatically, yet solemnly: \"Forever and ever, amen."}
{"translation": "And already she feels a clutch in her heart and tears well up in her eyes."}
{"translation": "She leans towards the boy, grabs his wrists, and he looks straight into her tear-filled eyes, still smiling, the little rascal."}
{"translation": "The first buildings appear before them abruptly, without warning."}
{"translation": "You can see the fog changes the sense of distance, because even Ka\u015bka herself seems surprised by this."}
{"translation": "Suddenly it jumps, jerking the shaft, and if not for the decisive reaction of Roszka and his whip, it would have overturned the carriage."}
{"translation": "Perhaps the sparks flying from the hearth frightened Kasia, or the unease of horses waiting for their turn to be shod."}
{"translation": "Everywhere is filled with the sickly smell of malt, penetrating every product laid out for sale."}
{"translation": "You can eat it like bread."}
{"translation": "In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babinci, there are a few small breweries, it's from there that this satisfying smell spreads throughout the whole area."}
{"translation": "Many stalls here sell beer, and better shops have both spirits and mead in stock, mainly trojniak."}
{"translation": "The store of the Jewish merchant Wakszul offers wine, real Hungarian and authentic Rhine, and a slightly sour kind that they bring all the way from Wallachia."}
{"translation": "There would be the most to say about the Wo\u0142owski family, as it has grown to enormous sizes."}
{"translation": "Almost all branches of this family were ennobled, some had the Baw\u00f3\u0142 coat of arms, others had the Na Kaskach coat of arms."}
{"translation": "Undoubtedly, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wo\u0142owski, the same person whom Father Chmielowski called Jeremiah, made a great career."}
{"translation": "He was born in 1786 in Br\u00fcnn and raised in Offenbach, he became one of the best lawyers and a law expert of his time."}
{"translation": "Interestingly, when a proposal to grant Polish citizenship to Jews appeared in the parliament, Franciszek as a deputy in his compelling speech argued that it was not yet time for such a step."}
{"translation": "First, the Polish nation must fight for independence, and then it will be time for social reforms."}
{"translation": "All Offenbach neophytes were buried in the city cemetery, which after years began to interfere with the city's expansion plans and was closed down in 1866."}
{"translation": "The bones of the people buried there were collected and respectfully reburied in another place."}
{"translation": "On this occasion, the skull of Jakub Frank was removed from the grave and, carefully described as the \"skull of a Jewish patriarch\", ended up in the hands of a historian in Offenbach city."}
{"translation": "Many years later, under unknown circumstances, she ended up in Berlin, where she underwent detailed measurements and examinations and was deemed an example of the Jewish racial minority."}
{"translation": "After the war, it disappeared without a trace, possibly destroyed in the wartime turmoil, turned to dust, or maybe it still lies in the underground storage of some museum."}
{"translation": "After Jakub's death, a time of great peace began for me."}
{"translation": "My main activity became studying the merkavah, and in addition to that, there were our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, since we lived in the same room, which brought us closer together."}
{"translation": "To him, to Jeruchim, I also told about Chai Szor that she was the only woman I could love and I loved from that beautiful moment when I had her for one night, when I arrived with the news about Jakub to Rohatyn."}
{"translation": "But above all, I loved Jakub."}
{"translation": "They were in Iwanow from April."}
{"translation": "If it weren't for the good people of Ivan, they would probably have starved to death."}
{"translation": "Fasting saved their lives and health, Bejla now feels better and does not cough as much anymore."}
{"translation": "Srol believes that once they are baptized, they will be just as well off as Christians."}
{"translation": "They will get a piece of land, Bejla will have vegetables in the garden, and he, Srol, will weave rugs, because he's good at it."}
{"translation": "In old age, when the girls are married off, they will take them in."}
{"translation": "These are all his dreams."}
{"translation": "Look, benefactor, Ka\u015bka doesn't want to go, says Roszko grimly when the carriage stops."}
{"translation": "Roszko gets off the goat and says goodbye several times with great flourish."}
{"translation": "Then he leans over and looks into the fog, as if looking into water."}
{"translation": "From under his festive red, albeit a bit faded, coat a shirt sticks out."}
{"translation": "I don't know where to go, he says."}
{"translation": "How do you not know?"}
{"translation": "\"But we are already on the Rohatyn road,\" says the surprised priest."}
{"translation": "And yet!"}
{"translation": "She gets out of the buggy and follows the servant, helplessly circling the carriage, straining her eyes into the whiteness."}
{"translation": "They seem to think they see something, but eyes that cannot latch onto anything begin to play tricks on themselves."}
{"translation": "That something like this happened to them!"}
{"translation": "After all, it's like getting lost in one's own pocket."}
{"translation": "\"Quiet!\" the priest suddenly says, raising his finger upward, listening intently."}
{"translation": "And indeed, somewhere on the left side, from the clumps of fog, a faint murmur of water can be heard."}
{"translation": "Let's follow that noise."}
{"translation": "It's the priest who decides where this water flows."}
{"translation": "Soon the priest relaxes in the carriage, stretches his legs out in front of him and lets his eyes wander over the sea of fog."}
{"translation": "He immediately falls into a traveling reverie, because a person thinks best when in motion."}
{"translation": "Slowly, reluctantly, the mechanism of his mind comes to life, surprising the gears and cogs, setting the drive wheels in motion, just like in the clock that stands in his presbytery hallway, bought in Lviv; he paid a hefty price for it."}
{"translation": "The chime will ring in a moment."}
{"translation": "One starts to wonder if perhaps the world didn't originate from such a fog."}
{"translation": "After all, the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius maintains that the world was created in autumn, during the autumnal equinox."}
{"translation": "One might think so because there were fruits in paradise; if an apple hung on the tree, it must have been autumn."}
{"translation": "There is some truth in this."}
{"translation": "But soon another thought comes to his mind:"}
{"translation": "What kind of argument is this?"}
{"translation": "Could not the almighty God create such poor fruits extra, at any time of the year?"}
{"translation": "When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join the stream of pedestrians, horse riders and various types of carts emerging from the fog, like figurines made out of bread for Christmas."}
{"translation": "It's Wednesday, market day in Rohatyn, peasant carts loaded with sacks of grain, cages of poultry, all sorts of agricultural produce are moving."}
{"translation": "Among them briskly march traders with all possible goods."}
{"translation": "Their stalls, now cleverly folded, can be carried on their backs like a yoke, and in a moment they will become tables full of colorful materials, wooden toys, eggs bought in the villages for a quarter of the price."}
{"translation": "Peasants also lead goats and cows for sale, the frightened animals, terrified by the noise, huddle in puddles."}
{"translation": "A speeding wagon, covered with a hole-ridden tarp, full of noisy Jews who come to the fair in Rohatyn from all around passes by them, and behind it fights its way a rich carriage, which struggles to maintain its dignity in the fog and congestion."}
{"translation": "Its shiny varnished doors are blackened with mud."}
{"translation": "The face of the coachman in his blue cloak seems sluggish apparently he did not expect such chaos and is now desperately looking for an opportunity to get off this devilish road."}
