{"translation": "\"Shut up,\" said the optician louder and walked faster, \"Selma rarely finds anything threatening or unattractive."}
{"translation": "He was completely right about that, and unfortunately, he said more than he should have responded to the voices."}
{"translation": "But love might indeed find her unattractive, the voices whispered, there was a reason, they said, why the truth was hidden for so long."}
{"translation": "\"That was cowardice,\" said the optician, shifting the leather bag to his other hip because the jostling of the bag and the jostling of voices slowly started to hurt."}
{"translation": "\"That was prudence,\" said the voices, \"Fear is sometimes a good advisor,\" they said and hummed the title melody of the early evening series."}
{"translation": "The optician is now slowing down."}
{"translation": "The journey to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly felt like a day's travel, a day's travel with very, very much luggage."}
{"translation": "That was true."}
{"translation": "The dog was the color of slushy snow, it was a washed-out gray and shaggy like a purebred Irish Wolfhound without anything else in it."}
{"translation": "His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear paws, and we all knew what that meant."}
{"translation": "Selma was still standing erect in front of the kitchen bench."}
{"translation": "She looked at the dog for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as Farmer H\u00e4ubel himself had been his entire life."}
{"translation": "He was certain that death would not snatch life away from him, but would gently take it from his hand."}
{"translation": "He imagined death knocking gently, only opening the door a crack and asking, \"May I?\", to which Farmer H\u00e4ubel would naturally agree."}
{"translation": "\"Of course,\" Farmer H\u00e4ubel would say, \"please come in,\" and Death would enter."}
{"translation": "He would stand by Farmer H\u00e4ubel's bed and ask: \"Is it convenient for you now?\""}
{"translation": "I can also come by at a later time."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel would sit up and say, \"No, no, it suits me just fine\", \"let us not postpone it again, who knows when you can arrange it again\", and Death would take a seat on the already prepared chair at the head of the table."}
{"translation": "He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which, as Farmer H\u00e4ubel knew, would not bother him at all, and then place a hand on Farmer H\u00e4ubel's eyes."}
{"translation": "The people in the village were uneasy, you could see it on them, even though they mostly tried not to show anything."}
{"translation": "This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, people in the village were moving as if black ice had formed on all paths, not only outside but also inside the houses, black ice in the kitchens and living rooms."}
{"translation": "They moved as if their own bodies were completely alien to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable."}
{"translation": "They grumbled about their life all day long and, as far as possible, everyone else's."}
{"translation": "Again and again they looked behind them, checking if someone might jump out with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing significant left to lose, and they quickly looked forward again because anyone without reason could also attack head-on."}
{"translation": "They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles, branches or heavy lampshades."}
{"translation": "They avoided all animals, because they believed it could break out faster from them than from humans."}
{"translation": "They circumvented the benign cows, which might lash out today, they avoided the dogs, even the very old ones that could barely stand but might still go for their throats today."}
{"translation": "On such days, anything was possible; even doddering dachshunds could bite through your throat, after all, it wasn't any more far-fetched than an okapi."}
{"translation": "Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were mostly not superstitious."}
{"translation": "They carefreely did all the things you're not supposed to do in superstitions:"}
{"translation": "They sat calmly under wall clocks, even though in superstition one can die from it, they slept with their heads towards the door, even though in superstition it means that one will soon be carried out through that very door feet first."}
{"translation": "They hung laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, in superstition equates to suicide or aiding and abetting murder."}
{"translation": "They were not frightened when the screech owl called at night, when a horse in the stable broke out in heavy sweat, when a dog howled at night with its head lowered."}
{"translation": "The train ride took fifteen minutes, there were no stops in between."}
{"translation": "Since our first train ride, we always played the same game:"}
{"translation": "We would stand with our backs to the windows at the opposite train doors, Martin would close his eyes, I would look out the window of the train door that was behind Martin."}
{"translation": "In the first grade, I told Martin what I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize everything."}
{"translation": "That worked out really well, so by the second school year I didn't have to list anything anymore and Martin, with his back to the window and eyes closed, could recite almost everything I saw through the fogged-up train window: \"Wire factory,\" he said, exactly at the moment we were passing by the wire factory."}
{"translation": "Now field."}
{"translation": "Pasture."}
{"translation": "The farmstead of the crazy Hassel."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Hunting stand one."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Pasture, pasture."}
{"translation": "Tire factory."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "Pasture."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "High seat two."}
{"translation": "Piece of forest."}
{"translation": "Court."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "High seat three."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "\"What else could it have been,\" said Selma, \"it's hard to confuse an okapi with any other animal."}
{"translation": "\"But,\" I said, \"it could also have been a malformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a freak of nature."}
{"translation": "And the stripes and the rust-red color, one cannot identify all that precisely in the night; after all, everything is quite blurry."}
{"translation": "\"That is just nonsense,\" Selma said, rubbing her forehead, \"that is unfortunately just nonsense, Luise."}
{"translation": "She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it over and put it in my lunchbox."}
{"translation": "\"Do you know exactly when you dreamed that?\""}
{"translation": "\"Around three o'clock,\" Selma said."}
{"translation": "She had jolted upright, after the image of the okapi had retreated, sitting up in bed she had awoken and stared at her nightgown, in which she had just stood on the Uhlheck in her dream, and then at the alarm clock."}
{"translation": "Three o'clock."}
{"translation": "\"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously,\" Selma said, but she said it like a television detective who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously."}
{"translation": "\"What's the matter?\""}
{"translation": "I asked."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma cooed, opening the fridge, taking out a pack of sliced cheese and a liver sausage, and waving them through the air."}
{"translation": "\"Little mouse,\" she cooed after him, and the cooing and the term \"little mouse\" were indeed alarming."}
{"translation": "\"Cheese, please,\" I said, \"what do you have then?\""}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" trilled Selma, \"just like I said."}
{"translation": "She spread butter on a slice of bread, and because she was still flailing about, she knocked the cheese off the counter with her wrist."}
{"translation": "Selma now stood still and looked down at the cheese package, as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces."}
{"translation": "Selma had dreamed of an Okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, so we were convinced that a dream about an Okapi and death were definitely linked."}
{"translation": "Our mind works like this."}
{"translation": "He can ensure in the shortest possible time that the most disparate things firmly belong together."}
{"translation": "Coffee pots and shoelaces for example, or deposit bottles and Christmas trees."}
{"translation": "When I slept downstairs at Selma's, she would tell me bedtime stories with happy endings."}
{"translation": "When I was younger, after the stories, I always grasped her wrist, put my thumb on her pulse and imagined that the whole world did everything to the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting a weight, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the retailer stocking juice boxes, my mother stacking spruce branches, my father stamping prescriptions, and all doing so in exact sync with Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "I always reliably fell asleep to that, but now, at the age of ten, Selma thought I was too old for it."}
