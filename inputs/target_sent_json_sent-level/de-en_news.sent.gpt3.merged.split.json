{"translation": "D."}
{"translation": "The device housing."}
{"translation": "Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, there is a console in the device that is intended as a platform for smaller players to make playing easier."}
{"translation": "At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site."}
{"translation": "These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1."}
{"translation": "If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol."}

{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression through which one could push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "She represented an opportunity for me to explore new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century."}
{"translation": "Century before:"}
{"translation": "To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations."}
{"translation": "Although this could naturally have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting disgusting monsters in dark corridors and shooting crates to get ammunition, but also has much more demanding and profound content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will have fun with this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are rather skeptical about playing video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will contribute to changing your attitude in this regard."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition."}
{"translation": "The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything for the first time."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many previously considered inviolable principles."}

{"translation": "You can use the nut or the entire surface."}
{"translation": "Worked without any problems."}
{"translation": "Nothing slips anymore."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again immediately."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, too big for under 1 year."}
{"translation": "The product itself is quite okay, but not recommended for under a year."}
{"translation": "Since the area for chewing is much too big for the small mouth."}
{"translation": "We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size."}
{"translation": "Now, after 12 months, we have taken him out again and he can use it."}
{"translation": "Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with its few existing teeth."}
{"translation": "And when he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, it will be returned."}
{"translation": "I seem to have been misled here by the partly extravagant reviews."}
{"translation": "I would like to point out that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use."}
{"translation": "A very large (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important everyday things that you just take with you."}
{"translation": "Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2. 8, the small Lowepro bag has now become permanently too small and I need a replacement."}
{"translation": "During Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase as I had read many of the reviews beforehand."}
{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, there was disappointment that followed."}
{"translation": "The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that."}
{"translation": "But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices."}
{"translation": "People, that's simply not true!"}
{"translation": "I was really hoping that it is like that, but there can really be no talk of it."}
{"translation": "The padded walls are significantly thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more fragile."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Even the zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high quality."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned."}
{"translation": "If I buy equipment worth thousands of EUR, unfortunately, I also have to spend money on a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "Quality apparently does have its price here."}
{"translation": "For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's not that the decision was difficult for me either."}
{"translation": "When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it would be returned."}
{"translation": "What I liked is the color inside."}
{"translation": "Here you will definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed by the third part."}
{"translation": "So far, I had liked the Electrics series by E. L. Todd the most, but my opinion was revised with this book."}
{"translation": "I found the first two books to be very powerful and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part."}
{"translation": "The entire part is about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to themselves, and then behaves like a little child and withdraws during every argument?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor was interested in him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and he heard it himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring back more suspense to the story."}
{"translation": "God"}
{"translation": "Human destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and doesn't learn!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not that bad as many people write."}
{"translation": "Sure, of course, the story is totally contrived and always planned out according to the same formula."}
{"translation": "If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and doesn't appreciate anything, and doesn't learn!"}
{"translation": "And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "Therefore, Jurassic World:"}
{"translation": "Fallen"}
{"translation": "Kingdom is really well made."}
{"translation": "It is just a pity that people simply don't get the message behind the movie, despite it being a mainstream film."}
{"translation": "We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves."}
{"translation": "Empathy for the environment and living beings: missing."}
{"translation": "4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise there could have been 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Still well-made popcorn cinema."}
{"translation": "a quiet, sensitive film"}
{"translation": "Some expect a film like 8 Mile here."}
{"translation": "This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one."}
{"translation": "Problematic"}
{"translation": "Taste like Quench from the 90s, forget about the orange, but that doesn't matter either."}
{"translation": "5 days every morning a little package: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing."}
{"translation": "My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm!"}
{"translation": "Flatulence like never before!"}
{"translation": "Afterwards, diarrhea 5-8 times a day."}
{"translation": "Not very helpful, unfortunately despite stopping immediately, the diarrhea has been lasting for 1 week."}
{"translation": "This is very very strange!"}
{"translation": "terrible smell and poor outcome!"}
{"translation": "I dyed my blond hair in October with an intensive tint into a chocolate brown, and in February/March I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I have used the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time I noticed immediately that it smells terrible!"}
{"translation": "However, there was still a not too bad result, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (slightly darker)."}
{"translation": "Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it one more time, as stated in the instructions, even if the results were not satisfactory."}
{"translation": "This time was pure waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It made no difference, my hair looked the same as with the first attempt."}
{"translation": "What was the worst thing of all, it still smelled weeks after application."}
{"translation": "No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away."}
{"translation": "Highly recommended"}
{"translation": "I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, always one tablet every 5 days."}
{"translation": "My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional prolonged illness."}
{"translation": "I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through healthy nutrition but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2."}
{"translation": "This works in a very good way."}
{"translation": "I feel fitter and much more comfortable."}
{"translation": "I sleep better and get up easier."}
{"translation": "The price is also great considering how long the tablets can be taken."}
{"translation": "Highly recommended."}
{"translation": "After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following severe defects which I find very annoying:"}
{"translation": "1) The case has difficulties connecting with the phone over time."}
{"translation": "This means that the device will not turn on even though the \"Power On/Off\" button has been pressed for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "When you remove the phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but a new defect arises as a result."}
{"translation": "2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone into the case, the cover has worn out so much that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I have almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "Although there aren't many major flaws, I believe that a case with a battery should function perfectly in its purpose, and therefore I am very disappointed in the product for the cost of 30\u20ac, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months."}
{"translation": "Too expensive, too thin and disappointing."}
{"translation": "I don't know how all these good ratings come about."}
{"translation": "In the end, it is actually an eyeglass cleaning cloth that you receive as a gift in slightly smaller form at every optician's."}
{"translation": "The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better."}
{"translation": "I expected much more from these towels, it is really very very thin."}
{"translation": "Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it."}
{"translation": "I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side."}
{"translation": "The price for these wipes is excessive; one should not pay more than 2 euros."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response."}
{"translation": "I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker that I got as a promotional gift unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "In general, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I've even dropped it in the shower), delivers bass like bass, Bluetooth works great."}
{"translation": "Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off."}
{"translation": "It can play sound very loud."}
{"translation": ".. yeah."}
{"translation": "What I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker."}
{"translation": "As I said, the bass is played as bass and not converted into a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are played back very loudly, while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the song almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough."}
{"translation": "My old speaker may not have reproduced bass well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in terms of volume."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying."}
{"translation": "So I have to deduct one star for that."}
{"translation": "I expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "In a few places, the paint had chipped off and when you just went over it with your hand, the paint also came off in some places."}
{"translation": "We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts, but how if both dressers were damaged."}
{"translation": "Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded us the money."}
{"translation": "A praise for Amazon"}
{"translation": "Dear spend a little more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts will be delivered, which you have to glue together yourself."}
{"translation": "The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no further protection."}
{"translation": "Since the mailman stuffed the product downright into my mailbox, a few templates have been damaged."}
{"translation": "I did not complain about it, as I urgently needed this product."}
{"translation": "Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one must be very careful not to glue everything together."}
{"translation": "The templates are partially incompletely punched out."}
{"translation": "For single use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding I would invest more money and go for a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "I am not unhappy."}
{"translation": "The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnet closure + beautiful appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars because you have to make everything fit in order to be truly satisfied."}
{"translation": "Also, I find it a bit too expensive."}
{"translation": "The coffee tastes good to me."}
{"translation": ".. but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive)."}
{"translation": "In that case, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a deduction of one star for me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points."}
{"translation": "It annoys me."}
{"translation": "The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "But: the natural sounds sound awful, and extremely loud as well."}
{"translation": "I couldn't make them quieter either."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, allegedly that is possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I immediately fall out of bed."}
{"translation": "In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning."}
{"translation": "I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately, the colored light cannot be dimmed."}
{"translation": "I also liked that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time don't have to be re-entered in case of a power outage."}
{"translation": "But returned for the reasons mentioned."}
{"translation": "Light great, processing insufficient."}
{"translation": "I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "There was also nothing in the box."}
{"translation": "Certainly, Amazon would have handled it leniently and quickly, but I only realized this after the return deadline."}
{"translation": "So I see that as my mistake and live with it."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very bright and uniformly illuminated."}
{"translation": "The light color tends more towards cold white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room, etc."}
{"translation": "For living spaces, I would personally opt for warmer light."}
{"translation": "Comparable to a good old 100 watt light bulb."}
{"translation": "However, other lamps can do that as well and perhaps I will also receive intact copies there according to the order."}
{"translation": "If my review should be helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating."}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I received gestures yesterday, and I would like to share my first impression."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive."}
{"translation": "I have been thinking for a long time whether I should order this set or not."}
{"translation": "The material is stable and it feels good in the hand."}
{"translation": "The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them up."}
{"translation": "The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots, and is particularly practical to use on pans with coating."}
{"translation": "They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 \u2109."}
{"translation": "They do not transfer the heat and can therefore be touched directly."}
{"translation": "The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But shortly after wiping and they're gone."}
{"translation": "Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and can only recommend it."}
{"translation": "Sold as new goods with minor defects"}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping simply outstanding."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked."}
{"translation": "We found that the part has already been installed before."}
{"translation": "We have found significant scratches and abrasions on all parts on Mondays."}
{"translation": "The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only now did we see that there are scratches/streaks on the chromed faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This item has probably already been delivered and returned."}
{"translation": "We will keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion;"}
{"translation": "We will never order such goods through Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get proper merchandise."}
{"translation": "I find it simply sad that customers are being messed with like this!!"}
{"translation": "Product itself great, unfortunately external sensor broke after 6 months."}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very easy, and the wireless range is very good, with no problems transmitting from inside to outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is kept very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after about."}
{"translation": "Seems to be broken after six months of usage, the device that measures the values externally."}
{"translation": "The thermometer seems to be intact, plausible values are still being displayed here."}
{"translation": "The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken because it always displays completely astronomical values for the outside air humidity."}
{"translation": "That is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected location and also the reason why I only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Strong mower with weak grass catcher"}
{"translation": "Apart from the fact that the first attempt of delivery is still happily traveling through the country with Hermes, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon as of today, the service from Amazon in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always."}
{"translation": "The lawnmower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression."}
{"translation": "The engine is powerful and it results in a nice cut."}
{"translation": "The volume is not particularly impressively low, but okay."}
{"translation": "A major downside is unfortunately the catch basket."}
{"translation": "On the one hand, it is made of hard plastic only at the top and bottom, and in between it is made of fabric."}
{"translation": "If you only set it down briefly while it's full, then it will naturally be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out."}
{"translation": "Even worse is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the catch basket is only half full."}
{"translation": "That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from there."}
{"translation": "Emptying the basket at a large lawn area when it is only half full cannot be the solution."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and returned it."}
{"translation": "Conclusion: Overall, a very good mower, but due to the unfortunate design of the grass catcher, it becomes unusable for me."}
{"translation": "Good device for monitoring"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated through the app."}
{"translation": "The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, and can also be extended if needed."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly constructed."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery power, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons, I am only giving 4 stars."}
{"translation": "This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router."}
{"translation": "You have to remove the batteries and then reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects again."}
{"translation": "That should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "3D printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly."}
{"translation": "The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there, and on the front right, the screw is practically coming out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The bars that hold the cart are straight, as is the table as well."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what to do there, because otherwise it is impossible to print something."}
{"translation": "Regarding the setup:"}
{"translation": "The setup was quite easy, one could only demonstrate how to lay the cables because otherwise they have to be laid again several times, which is very tiring."}
{"translation": "I have already contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, returning is no longer possible."}
{"translation": "I had expected a little more."}
{"translation": "robust and precise, I am positively surprised"}
{"translation": "My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be bought."}
{"translation": "This one makes a very sturdy impression and is equally precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "Two batteries are included so that you can start right away."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the slide is simple, but fully serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give it full points and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "From me there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell"}
{"translation": "Bought the bracelet and haven't worn it yet, as it emits a disgusting odor."}
{"translation": "Until today, this smell has not gone away, even though it has been \"aired out\" constantly."}
{"translation": "After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it."}
{"translation": "Rate from purchasing"}
{"translation": "For the price it's okay."}
{"translation": "The stars and spheres on this necklace have grown a bit too large for my liking, making it look quite heavy."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain is overall very simply processed, so that I have already ripped the closure open twice."}
{"translation": "So far, I have been able to repair it over and over again, but I think that won't last long."}
{"translation": "But for the affordable price, one simply cannot expect anything of really high quality."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry"}
{"translation": "One just has to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more supple."}
{"translation": "Only: anyone who has something magnetic on their arm: the clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately garbage!"}
{"translation": "I was already disappointed after unpacking because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was okay."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "It only connects after some tinkering."}
{"translation": ".. if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it did the transmitters finally connect."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy did not last long because the connection was lost again after only one hour, despite the transmitters being next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Also, the display of the three channels was very different!"}
{"translation": "Overall, not useful for me!"}
{"translation": "The thing was returned!"}
{"translation": "Would definitely advise against a purchase, only brings trouble!"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Transport damage Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3. 5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off."}
{"translation": "I only bought them again for one reason, I needed them urgently because of the current drought, and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the wave at the previous pump had a production error and that the current pump will perform its services a little longer."}
{"translation": "The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled cardboard."}
{"translation": "I still kept the pump, as described above, because I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect its pumping capacity."}
{"translation": "Could have been thought through better."}
{"translation": "Since I frequently deal with many different keys, I thought that having an organizer would be more convenient than constantly carrying around a huge keychain."}
{"translation": "At first, everything went quite well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint quickly started to come off and the screws had to be tightened constantly."}
{"translation": "Nice that it also works with a one-cent coin, but only with a one-cent coin."}
{"translation": "I did not find a suitable slot screwdriver that would not immediately ruin the entire screw."}
{"translation": "Now, let's get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It is nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes and wenig is alles zusammensetzten kann."}
{"translation": "Once the lengths are adjusted, it is important to have the whole thing screwed together before you will need pliers to take it apart again."}
{"translation": "Finally, the third time I was assembling it, the screw broke off in the thread and therefore the whole thing became useless."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all, then only for once with all necessary keys and never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions."}
{"translation": "Smooth-running zippers, the material looks sturdy and all of this in featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after its first use."}
{"translation": "In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than stated."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't really imagine everything there, for example."}
{"translation": "To pack for a three-week vacation."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as two smaller bags/pouches were also included in the round cosmetic bag."}
{"translation": "Not processed with high quality, but I still wanted to mention it."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't personally bother me."}
{"translation": "So-so"}
{"translation": "So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well."}
{"translation": "Now, as I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Exchanged."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "So I could have just thrown the money directly into the garbage bin."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is easy, but one should be very careful when approaching the brush in order not to damage the needle."}
{"translation": "I could not hear an improvement in sound quality with my very high-quality turntable."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Two black cables were included."}
{"translation": "Battery life lasts for a very long time."}
{"translation": "Definitely completely sufficient sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cups are very soft and comfortable to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also kept very low."}
{"translation": "Purchase recommendation in this price range."}
{"translation": "stylish dress"}
{"translation": "Very beautiful dress, which is wearable for a variety of occasions."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I got it in a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wish that the neckline wasn't so plunging, and the sleeves could also use a bit more fabric (if you don't have arms as slim as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Hands off."}
{"translation": "It can't get any worse."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously did not expect that such garbage is being sold nowadays."}
{"translation": "The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized very unreliably at most."}
{"translation": "The discs must be inserted several times, afterwards it makes rattling noises like those heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90s."}
{"translation": "After minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will happen anymore, or the disc will finally be recognized."}
{"translation": "But under no circumstances should you press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the movie, or anything else for that matter."}
{"translation": "This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze."}
{"translation": "In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included."}
{"translation": "If you purchase PowerDVD or similar software separately, the price of this optical drive doubles."}
{"translation": "Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First and foremost, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually a deception, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know that at the time of purchase, which is why I was a little disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "But apart from the visual appearance and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its duty very reliably."}
{"translation": "And because of the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick does not simply dangle around like with a regular extension cord."}
{"translation": "So not a real bad purchase, but my enthusiasm is limited :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but mighty!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I can have an audio output and connect a display to my iPad (Pro)."}
{"translation": "With iOS 12, it is now possible to move data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters that I also had to return unfortunately could not do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to the tablet and the HDMI is connected to the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Sound is delivered via HDMI."}
{"translation": "What else do I use my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This one is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic mounting."}
{"translation": "With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter."}
{"translation": "Well, it holds securely like that and has contact as well."}
{"translation": "Overall, somewhat expensive but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "Also very small, the whole thing is made stable in one piece of aluminum."}
{"translation": "Price-performance ratio is good."}
{"translation": "Lots of power"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Running smoothly for months."}
{"translation": "Is not easy or quiet but delivers good performance."}
{"translation": "I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) to be rather cool and therefore I always use level 2."}
{"translation": "It has also fallen multiple times onto the tiled floor and has survived it well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competing products sometimes tend to look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good."}
{"translation": "The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression."}
{"translation": "In operation, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised."}
{"translation": "In live mode, the tracking is accurate to approximately 0. 5 meters."}
{"translation": "In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump a few meters, but it is not disturbing."}
{"translation": "I would buy him back anytime."}
{"translation": "However, what would be great is a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "Currently, he lasts about 1. 5 hours per day."}
{"translation": "A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great here."}
{"translation": "There is indeed an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the battery wouldn't need to last that long for us, and we also find it inconvenient to change it daily."}
{"translation": "One should engage with the dog and not with its collar :-) ."}
{"translation": "The app also worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks, trash"}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and also seem to be comfortable."}
{"translation": "However, the lifespan is increasingly decreasing."}
{"translation": "Although my son only wears the shoes during physical education class, the sole already breaks after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore."}
{"translation": "With the last pair, it was the same in normal use that they didn't last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, these look poorly processed at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly finished and the ankle strap is quite loose, and it is very likely that it will not last five years like my previous ones did."}
{"translation": "I am excited!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Since there are hardly any reviews to read here yet, I was initially very skeptical."}
{"translation": "However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I decided to give it a try and ordered them just on a whim."}
{"translation": "The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump."}
{"translation": "About the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing purposes."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there is some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it away and hope that it doesn't reappear."}
{"translation": "A lying test was conducted directly in the inflated state."}
{"translation": "It is comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits wonderfully into my car."}
{"translation": "Before, we removed the seats in the back."}
{"translation": "Thus it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "The air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has different adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint)."}
{"translation": "Since my friend is skilled at crafts, he was able to repair it and once assembled again, the good part worked excellently and quickly inflated the mattress."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress."}
{"translation": "I'm curious to see the acid test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it doesn't lose air and also lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "Similarly, that the mold does not reappear."}
{"translation": "After the test, I can already recommend it."}
{"translation": "If I should have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me."}
{"translation": "1. For fast shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar has been torn open through shoddy processing right on day 1 over several doors."}
{"translation": "On the 21st day, there were no more doors left, and I had to more or less allow my son to also remove the remaining parts since they practically fell out towards him."}
{"translation": "The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that the car has to be taken apart again in order to attach the parts."}
{"translation": "After the car is fully assembled, parts come off while playing."}
{"translation": "Mostly the windshield."}
{"translation": "In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and also not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"translation": "Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider how they designed the calendar for the next issue and improve it."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am fascinated by the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it."}
{"translation": "Inside, it flies very well and lasts 5 minutes."}
{"translation": "Flight times are usually sufficient."}
{"translation": "I expected that hair would get tangled in it and the drone would break very quickly at this price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether on tiles or carpet, are not a problem."}
{"translation": "For questions, please contact us kindly."}
{"translation": "Game okay but only playable with the requirement of using Steam."}
{"translation": "I did not see at the time of purchase that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be fine so far, but one is forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which would not be the case with a clean installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime."}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the clock."}
{"translation": "Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without any problems."}
{"translation": "Service went well."}
{"translation": ".. and yet I am returning it."}
{"translation": "The big drawback: the battery and its runtime."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, only left on the shelf overnight, and 11% less battery in the morning without usage."}
{"translation": "Many messages came during the day, and by noon / early afternoon the battery was already at its end, and then you can't even read the time."}
{"translation": "Therefore not useful for me."}
