{"translation": "The boundless sea noise did not stop for a minute."}
{"translation": "He ran in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding."}
{"translation": "And the wind would start rustling in the bare trees, then go quiet, just as I was listening to the flow of the night."}
{"translation": "But he didn't leave, he was here."}
{"translation": "I knew this by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf."}
{"translation": "I noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, rifle shots echoed out of the darkness, out of the city."}
{"translation": "After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then a dim light flickered far out at sea and went out."}
{"translation": "He made us look at these things more closely and longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that we had not noticed before."}
{"translation": "Yes, in the porous yellow stone, there were many small sea shells firmly embedded in it."}
{"translation": "On the rockrose bushes, a few flowers remained, they sat on straight firm stems like soaked and wrinkled golden butterflies, patiently awaiting the sun."}
{"translation": "But it very rarely appeared in the fog as a blurred white spot, and gave neither warmth nor shadow."}
{"translation": "Under the single old plane tree with lemon spots on the trunk, leaves lay as if cut out of dull green velvet."}
{"translation": "Through the iron gate, ants ran in a line, carrying their last reserves for the winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain."}
{"translation": "At night, on the other side of the river, someone started waving a lantern and shouting loudly."}
{"translation": "I went out with my uncle."}
{"translation": "Go ashore, Ilko."}
{"translation": "The river roared."}
{"translation": "The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall."}
{"translation": "The night was late, deafening, not a single star overhead."}
{"translation": "The face was blasted with the wild freshness of the expanse, of the thawed earth."}
{"translation": "And all the time someone on the other bank waved a lantern and shouted, but the words couldn't be made out over the noise of the river."}
{"translation": "When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses unharnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black mourning dress."}
{"translation": "She stood motionless on the shore."}
{"translation": "She saw from there as they took her father away."}
{"translation": "Then she knelt down and fell headfirst into the sand."}
{"translation": "No, the grandfather replied."}
{"translation": "That's true, we haven't seen each other."}
{"translation": "Ostap began to lose his sight."}
{"translation": "He decided then to go all the way to Petersburg, to see that woman before he went completely blind."}
{"translation": "He reached the imperial capital and found out that she had died, presumably, couldn't bear the separation."}
{"translation": "Ostap found her gravestone of white marble in the cemetery, he looked, and his heart broke on the stone lay his iron rose."}
{"translation": "That woman bequeathed to place a rose on her grave."}
{"translation": "Forever."}
{"translation": "And Ostap started to play the fool and, presumably, died on the road or at the market under a wagon."}
{"translation": "Amen!"}
{"translation": "On that shore, the countess Branitsky's protected forest rose up the slope."}
{"translation": "The sun could not break through the dense greenery of this forest."}
{"translation": "Only occasionally a solitary ray cut through the thicket at an angle, revealing to us the stunning power of vegetation."}
{"translation": "Like sparkling specks of dust, little birds flew into this ray."}
{"translation": "They squealed as they chased each other and dove into the foliage, as if it were green water."}
{"translation": "I was filling a bucket with water from the pond, throwing grass into this water and waiting."}
{"translation": "The red floats stood motionless in the water."}
{"translation": "Then one of them would start shivering, would make light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim aside."}
{"translation": "Father was reeling in, the line was tightening, the walnut rod was bending into an arc, and over the mist above the pond there began a bubbling, splashing, hustle."}
{"translation": "The water rippled, rocking the lily pads, the water beetles hurriedly scurried in all directions, and finally a pulsating golden glow appeared in the mysterious depths."}
{"translation": "It was impossible to figure out what it was until the father dragged a heavy crucian onto the trampled grass."}
{"translation": "He lay on his side, gasping and fluttering his fins."}
{"translation": "An amazing scent of the underwater kingdom came from his scales."}
{"translation": "Yasha was counting the seconds to himself."}
{"translation": "We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzovsky Lane to the Landesman Sanatorium."}
{"translation": "In the sanatorium, behind a tall fence and iron gates, we always felt completely safe."}
{"translation": "Especially if they didn't light up the smokehouses."}
{"translation": "As we were passing by the gateway, Yasha stumbled."}
{"translation": "Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzovsky Lane, Yasha claimed that every time you want to do something in the best possible way, you are bound to stumble over a trifle."}
{"translation": "I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything."}
{"translation": "But I kept silent so as not to upset Yasha."}
{"translation": "We stealthily went down the alley."}
{"translation": "I said that we need to go on the side where the archway is, stop before reaching it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently dart past the archway."}
{"translation": "The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically precise."}
{"translation": "If there are people in the alley, they might not notice us."}
{"translation": "If we go on the opposite side from the alley, we can be spotted from afar."}
{"translation": "I calculated that in the last case we would be going against a dangerous alleyway, or rather, we would be in sight of people hiding in the alleyway five times longer."}
{"translation": "And, therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed."}
{"translation": "In the morning, I was awakened by the hot sun hitting the white walls."}
{"translation": "Red and yellow hollyhocks swayed behind the open window."}
{"translation": "Together with them, a nasturtium flower peeked into the room; a furry bee sat inside it."}
{"translation": "I watched, frozen, as she angrily retreated and extricated herself from the tight flower."}
{"translation": "Bright streams ran endlessly across the ceiling, light waves reflecting off the river."}
{"translation": "The river roared right here, nearby."}
