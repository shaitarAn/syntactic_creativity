{"translation": "In the winter of 1993, the most important thing to me was my father's return, which happened just a week before my mother's wedding."}
{"translation": "One afternoon in December, he came to the school to look for me."}
{"translation": "I sprinted towards the entrance, my gaze fixed on him standing outside, smoke billowing from his cigarette."}
{"translation": "Wearing a black long-sleeved shirt with the collar covering half of my face."}
{"translation": "\"I don't know why, but I couldn't even see his face clearly, and I just felt that he was not doing well."}
{"translation": "My heart is sour, and tears have fallen out."}
{"translation": "I never thought my mother would have the idea of remarrying."}
{"translation": "Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should have been suffering all along because of my father's departure, just like me."}
{"translation": "Moreover, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness."}
{"translation": "\"Reality may be true, but happiness has the power to find her."}
{"translation": "\"No, as a beauty, she doesn't have to work hard at all."}
{"translation": "She can just stand there and that's enough."}
{"translation": "I still remember that winter was particularly long that year, and it was already mid-April before the spring flowers had bloomed."}
{"translation": "Your parents' divorce has left you feeling emotionally drained."}
{"translation": "We haven't had any new games for a long time, and every evening we'd just lazily sit on the rooftop of the building, bored out of our minds. : 'In the courtyard, there were several more chicken wings scattered among the various body parts."}
{"translation": "We used hooks to pull them together and created a thousand-hand Guanyin."}
{"translation": "My father didn't have the slightest idea how to do business."}
{"translation": "He just went to work for a distant relative he wasn't familiar with."}
{"translation": "My grandmother has a younger sister, who went to Beijing in her early years and later got married and had children there."}
{"translation": "This man is the eldest son of the family and has always been an outcast within the entire clan."}
{"translation": "\"You just said that everyone has a start-up time, life seems to suddenly put on the reins."}
{"translation": "I should have been eight years old."}
{"translation": "That autumn, Father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone."}
{"translation": "After that, I never had a home again."}
{"translation": "I don't plan to go on a date."}
{"translation": "No matter what the reason is, I think we don't need to see each other again."}
{"translation": "I sat on the sofa, puffing on a cigarette, watching the sky gradually darken, when suddenly there was a loud knock on the door."}
{"translation": "Send"}
{"translation": "The boy carrying the water bucket is standing at the door, saying he has delivered water to a household in the west suburb."}
{"translation": "He wore a dirty, gray woolen hat with a calm and collected expression."}
{"translation": "Our conversation is proving to be quite challenging."}
{"translation": "Every time I fall into silence, I feel my heart is oppressed, and I just want to quickly end this meeting."}
{"translation": "You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic to talk about."}
{"translation": "The tea has gone cold, the white mist in the house has dispersed, and you have finally gotten up to leave."}
{"translation": "I just closed the door and felt a sense of relief, when the doorbell rang again."}
{"translation": "\"You're standing at the gate, asking me to come to the small white building later."}
{"translation": "I haven't had a chance to explain myself yet, but you've already left the building."}
{"translation": "I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove."}
{"translation": "The water has already evaporated half a bowl, and the entire room is enveloped in white mist."}
{"translation": "You sit down quickly and watch me pour the tea."}
{"translation": "Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"}
{"translation": "\"You ask."}
{"translation": "I tell you, grandma has passed away, and now I'm living with my aunt."}
{"translation": "She never got married."}
{"translation": "\"Hmm."}
{"translation": "The white breath that comes out of your mouth, the curly hair that is blown up by the wind, the slight tremble of your knees under the long coat, these make me believe that you in front of me are real, not a continuation of the dream I had before."}
{"translation": "Eighteen years have passed, it's not strange that I don't recognize you."}
{"translation": "You haven't put on makeup, your pale face has a hint of puffiness, but you've still exceeded everyone's expectations and become a beauty."}
{"translation": "\"Just that peach-like little face, with a hint of sadness and loneliness, a divine presence that has been lingering in the bustling city for a long time."}
{"translation": "\"You ask me, your appearance is not the same as I imagined."}
{"translation": "I couldn't help but laugh."}
{"translation": "\"I must admit, I've never imagined what you'd look like when you grew up."}
{"translation": "As far as I'm concerned, everything related to you has been packed away in a file and sealed with wax."}
{"translation": "\"I may have hurt someone's feelings by saying this, but I really haven't been looking forward to seeing you again."}
{"translation": "I open my eyes."}
{"translation": "You are standing in the doorway."}
{"translation": "I don't know how long you've been standing there, but even in my dreams, I saw you laughing."}
{"translation": "There's still the lingering sorrow, the most fleeting moment of fragility."}
{"translation": "\"Cheng Gong, you call out my name in a low voice, the sound is very hoarse, as if you haven't spoken in a long time."}
{"translation": "It's going to snow soon, the sky is dark and gloomy, and the house is pitch black inside."}
{"translation": "The water on the stove is boiling, bubbling and churning away."}
{"translation": "I carefully looked at you for a while and confirmed that I don't recognize you."}
{"translation": "However, in the dim light, I suddenly felt a profound connection between my life and the stranger standing opposite me."}
{"translation": "That feeling sends a chill down my spine."}
{"translation": "I strive to recall, and the memories flood my mind like a deck of cards shuffling through."}
{"translation": "\"Then you say, you are Li Qianyuan."}
