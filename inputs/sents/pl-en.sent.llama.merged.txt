He looks at the family, just girls, the mother with a child at her breast gets off awkwardly from the carriage, and the driver urges her on, because the horse needs to return quickly to pick up others in the suburbs. A bundle falls from her back, spilling a few faded rags and a single string of small, darkened beads. The woman gathers them, embarrassed, as if she had just revealed her most intimate secrets to the world. The boy dashes towards her and suddenly stops in front of her, perhaps six or seven years old, looking at her with bright, happy eyes, and exclaims: "Praise be to Jesus Christ!" She responds automatically, yet charmingly: "For ages to come, amen." She already has a firm grip on her heart and tears are welling up in her eyes. The woman takes the boy by the wrists, and he looks her straight in the eye, full of tears, still smiling, little scamp.
The first buildings rise up before them, suddenly, without warning. The fog changes the feeling of distance, because Kasia herself seems surprised by it.Or, more idiomatically:The fog alters the sense of distance, and Kasia appears taken aback by it. Suddenly, he jumps, squealing, and if it weren't for Roszek's prompt reaction and his bat, he would have turned the cart over. Maybe Kaska was startled by the sparks flying from the bonfire, or the restlessness of the horses waiting their turn to be shod...
Everywhere I can smell the strong scent of mold, it permeates every item on display for sale. One can eat it like bread. In the outskirts of Rohatyn, in Babińce, there are several small breweries, from where the enticing aroma spreads throughout the surrounding area. Many vendors sell beer here, but better shops have mead, honey, and fruit brandy. The Jewish merchant Wakszul's warehouse offers wine, genuine Hungarian and genuine Renish, and a bit of quirky stuff that they bring all the way from Wallachia.
The most would be to say about the Wołowskich family, since it has grown to enormous sizes. Almost all branches of this family were ennobled, some bore the Bawół coat of arms, while others bore the Na Kaskach coat of arms. Indisputably, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wołowski, made a great career for himself, the same one whom Father Chmielowski called Jeremiasz. He was born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, becoming one of the best lawyers and legal experts of his time. It was intriguing when a bill was introduced in parliament to grant Polish citizenship to Jews, but Franciszek, as a member of parliament, gave a passionate speech arguing that it was not yet time for such a step. The Polish nation must first win its independence, and then it will be time for social reforms.
All the Offenbach neophytes were buried in the municipal cemetery, which, however, began to hinder the city's expansion plans and was eventually abolished in 1866. The bones of those buried people were collected and buried with respect in another place. On this occasion, the skull of Jacob Frank was removed from the grave and, described carefully as "the skull of a Jewish patriarch," found its way into the hands of a historian from Offenbach. Many years later, in unknown circumstances, she ended up in Berlin, where she was subjected to detailed measurements and examinations and identified as an example of Jewish racial inferiority. After the war, it may have been destroyed by the chaos of war, scattered in the dust, or still lies in the underground storage rooms of some museum.
After Jakub's death, a time of great peace came for me. My main occupation became studying the Talmud, and our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, as we lived in the same room, brought us closer together. I told him, Jeruchim, that Chai Shor was the only woman I could love and I loved her from that beautiful moment on, when I spent a night with her, and I came to Rohatyn with news about Jacob. But above all, I loved Jacob.
They were in Ivano-Frankivsk from April. If it weren't for the kind-hearted people from Iwań, we would have probably died of hunger. The rain saved their lives and health, Beyla feels better now and doesn't cough as much. "He believes that when they are baptized, it will be just as good for them as it is for Christians." They will get a piece of land, Bejla will have vegetables in the garden, and he, Srol, will weave carpets, because he does it well. When old women marry off their daughters, they take them in. All his dreams.
Look, sir, Kasia doesn't want to go, she's sulking, says Roszko, when the stroller stops. Roshko gets off the horse and says goodbye a few times with a gloomy face. He leaned over and peared into the fog, as if looking into the water. From under his festive red, albeit slightly faded cap, a shirt emerges. I don't know where to go, he says. "You don't know that?" "Well, we're already on the road to Rohatyn, says the surprised priest." Oh, really! He gets out of the pram and follows the servant, walking aimlessly around the carriage, straining his eyes in the whiteness. They seem to see something, but the eyes that cannot grasp anything begin to play tricks on them. They also had something similar happen to them! It's as if you've lost yourself in your own pocket. "Quiet! says the priest suddenly, and raises his finger to the sky, listening." Indeed, somewhere from the left, from the misty waves, a faint sound of water comes through. Let's go beyond the noise. The water flows, the priest decides.
The priest soon relaxes in the embrace, stretches out his legs and allows his eyes to wander over the sea of fog. He immediately falls into a traveler's reverie, for a man's thoughts are best in motion. Freely, with a subtle animation, he sets in motion the gears of his mind, surprising modes and transitions, propelling the drive shaft, just like the clock that stands in his parlor, purchased in Lviv; he paid a pretty penny for it. "In a moment, the ding-dong will sound." Doesn't the world seem to be emerging from such a fog, it starts to ponder. "Jewish historian Joseph Flavius maintains that the world was created in the fall, during the autumnal equinox." One can assume that, for in paradise there were fruits; since the apple hung on the tree, it must have been autumn... There is some reason in this. And suddenly, another thought comes to his mind: What kind of argument is this? Couldn't the all-powerful God create extra fruit in whatever season?
When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join the stream of pedestrians, horses, and various vehicles emerging from the fog, like Christmas cookie cutouts. It's Wednesday, market day in Rohatyn, peasant carts loaded with grain, eggs, and various agricultural products are driving through the streets. Between them, lively peddlers march with every possible item in their carts, cleverly arranged now, they carry them on their shoulders like squirrels, and in a moment they will become tables full of colorful materials, wooden toys, eggs collected from villages for a quarter of the price... The peasants also lead goats and cows to sell animals, frightened by the noise, they get stuck in the mud. Their hasty departure was accompanied by a noisy crowd of Jews, who were rushing to the fair in Rohatyn from all over the surrounding area, while a luxurious carriage, its dignity obscured by the fog and the throng on the road, struggled to maintain its composure. The black doors were covered in mud, and the woman in the blue pelerine seemed to be in a state of distress, not expecting such chaos. She desperately searched for a way to escape from this devilish road.
