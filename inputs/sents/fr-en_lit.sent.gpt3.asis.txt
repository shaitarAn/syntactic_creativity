Two other small photos with scalloped edges, probably from the same year, show the same child, but smaller, in a dress with ruffles and balloon sleeves. In the first one she snuggled mischievously against a woman with a solid body, all in one piece in a dress with wide stripes, her hair rolled up in big curls. On the other, she raises her left fist, her right is held back by the hand of a tall man in a light jacket and pleated trousers, with a nonchalant posture. The two photos were taken on the same day in front of a wall topped with a flower border, in a paved courtyard. Above the heads a clothesline passes by with a pin still hooked onto it.
Another photo, signed by the same photographer—but the paper of the booklet is more ordinary and the gold edging has disappeared—presumably destined for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of about four years old, serious, almost sad despite a good round face under short hair, parted in the middle and pulled back with barrettes to which ribbons are attached, like butterflies. The left hand rests on the same carved table, fully visible, in the Louis XVI style. She appears to be pinched in her blouse, her suspender skirt is pulled up in front due to a prominent belly, perhaps a sign of rickets (1944, approximately).
The boys were proud to go to the regiment and they looked handsome in their uniforms. On the evening of their conscription review, they went around the cafes celebrating the glory of being recognized as real men. Before joining the regiment, they were still kids and were worth nothing in the job and marriage markets. Afterwards, they could have a wife and children. The uniforms they wore when they had leave to go out in the neighborhood wrapped them in a patriotic beauty and a virtual sacrifice. The shadows of the victorious fighters, the GIs, hung around them. The rough cloth of the uniform, brushed against when one stood on tiptoe to kiss them, materialized the absolute divide between the world of men and the world of women. Seeing them evoked a feeling of heroism.
Amidst the immutability, the circus posters from last year with the photo of Roger Lanzac, the first communion pictures distributed to the comrades, the Songwriters Club on Radio Luxembourg, the days were filled with new desires. On Sunday afternoons, people crowded around the window of the general electrical store to watch television. Cafes were investing in the purchase of a television set to attract customers. On the slopes of the hills, motocross tracks snaked around and one could watch the deafening machines go up and down all day long. The growing impatience of commerce with its new watchwords, "initiative" and "dynamism", was shaking up the everyday life of the cities. Between the carnival and the fair, the Commercial Fortnight was established as a rite of spring. In the downtown streets, loudspeakers blared out exhortations to buy interspersed with songs by Annie Cordy and Eddie Constantine, to win a Simca or a dining room set. On the podium in front of City Hall, a local host was making people laugh with Roger Nicolas and Jean Richard's jokes, and was recruiting contestants for the Hook or Double or Nothing game, just like on the radio. Seated in a corner of the podium, the Queen of Commerce reigned beneath her crown. The merchandise was moving along in a festive atmosphere. People said, "It's a change" or "We mustn't get stuck in a rut, it's stupefying to stay at home."
But they only talked of what they had seen, which could be relived by eating and drinking. They lacked the talent or the conviction to speak of what they knew but had not seen. Neither of Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor of the dead of hunger picked up in the morning in the Warsaw ghetto, nor of the 10,000 degrees in Hiroshima. This left an impression that history classes, documentaries, and films later could not dispel: neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb were in the same era as the black market butter, air raid sirens, and trips to the basement.
They then compared it to the previous war, the Great War of 1914, which had been won in blood and glory, a war of men that the women at the table listened to with respect. They talked about the Chemin des Dames and Verdun, the gassed, the bells of November 11, 1918. They named villages from which not a single child who had gone off to war had returned. They compared the soldiers in the mud of the trenches to the prisoners of 1940, warm and safe for five years, who hadn't even been bombed. They were vying for heroism and misfortune.
The children weren't listening and were in a hurry to leave the table as soon as they were given permission, taking advantage of the general benevolence of festival days to indulge in forbidden games, jumping on the beds and swinging upside down. But they kept it all to themselves. Next to the fabulous time—the episodes of which they would not arrange for a long time yet—the Debacle, the Exodus, the Occupation, the Landing, the Victory—they found the nameless one in which they were growing up dull. They regretted not having been born, or barely, when they had to march in a cohort on the roads and sleep on straw like gypsies. They would keep a lingering regret for that time they had not lived. The memories of others instilled in them a secret nostalgia for that era they had missed by so little, and the hope of living it one day.
The frenzy that had followed Liberation was fading. Then people only thought of getting out, and the world was full of desires to be satisfied at once. Everything that constituted the first time since the war caused a rush, the bananas, the lottery tickets, the fireworks. Whole neighborhoods, from the grandmother supported by her daughters to the baby in the pram, rushed to the fair, to the torchlight parade, to the Bouglione circus where they almost got trampled in the crush. They thronged in prayer and song along the road to welcome the statue of Our Lady of Boulogne and accompany it the next day for miles. Whether it was a secular or religious occasion, they were always happy to be together outside, as if they wanted to keep living collectively. On Sunday evenings, the buses returned from the sea with tall young men in shorts, singing at the top of their lungs, perched on the luggage rack. The dogs were roaming freely and mating in the middle of the street.
Family story and social story are one and the same. The voices of the guests outlined the spaces of youth: the countryside and the farms where, in forgotten memory, the men had been hired and the girls servants, the factory where they had all met, courted and married, the small businesses where the most ambitious had found their way. They depicted stories with no personal events other than births, marriages and deaths, no trips outside the regiment to a distant garrison town, lives filled with work, its harshness and weariness, and the threat of drink. School was a mythical backdrop, a brief golden age of which the Teacher had been the stern god with his iron ruler to rap on the knuckles.
Browned photos were being passed from hand to hand, their backs stained by all the fingers that had held them in other meals, a mixture of coffee and melted fat blended into an indefinable color. Among the stiff and solemn wedding-party, the guests of the wedding arranged in several rows along a wall, one could not recognize either one's parents or anyone else. It wasn’t oneself that one saw in the half-naked, sexless baby on the cushion, but someone else, a creature belonging to a silent and inaccessible time.
