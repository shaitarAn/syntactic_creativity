Miho and Satsuki often meet locally, which is why they have similar facial expressions and ways of speaking. Especially the way they eat sweets is similar, and both of them are nail artists, breaking cookies into small pieces with their hands and bringing them to their mouths. It seems like it's been that way from the beginning, but I can't quite remember. The small habits and mannerisms of the two people I met before may have flowed away somewhere else, or so I think.
Miho has married and bought a used single-family home in the countryside, where her friends often gather. "I sometimes feel frustrated when I have to work part-time jobs tomorrow, but I consider it a valuable opportunity to interact with people outside of convenience stores and to spend time with a normal, thirty-something woman like Miho. So, I try to accept her invitations whenever possible." Today, Miho, Yukari who has a small child, Satsuki who is married without any children yet, and I gathered at Miho's house for tea with a cake that we brought.
At that time, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time. I think I was born now. I, a normal part of the world, was certainly born on this day.
For two weeks until the opening, we practiced as a two-person team, facing off against each other as if we were fictional customers. "I will look into the customer's eyes and smile faintly, put the sanitary products in a paper bag, separate the warm items from the cold ones, and disinfect my hands with alcohol when handling fast food." The cash register contained real money for practice, but the receipt clearly marked "training", and the other person was a part-time coworker in the same uniform, it all felt like a pretend shopping game.
Two years younger than me, my sister was a normal child, unlike me, and she didn't avoid me but rather admired me. When my sister and I are treated differently by our mother, I approach her and ask, "Why are you angry with me, too?" After I inquired to my mother, my sister would always express her gratitude to me, believing she had been spared the lecture. I, who had little interest in sweets or toys, often gave them to my younger sister. Therefore, my sister was always clinging to me.
"Dad, I love grilled chicken, so let's grill some today. I think I didn't hear you say it clearly, so I'll say it again with a clear pronunciation. Mom was startled, and the other mothers nearby were also surprised, their eyes, noses, and mouths opening wide in shock." He had a strange look on his face, so I thought he might be laughing at me, but then I saw that he was staring at my hand, and I thought, "Ah, that's not enough." "Should I take more? When I casually glance at a few sparrows walking side by side nearby, my mother who finally came to her senses, cried out desperately in a scolding tone, 'Keiko!'" "Let's build a grave and bury him, shall we?" Hey, everyone's crying too. My friends died and it's lonely. "Hey, isn't it pitiful? Why? Even though they're already dead. At my question, my mother was at a loss for words."
"Put the canned coffee, cigarettes, and American dogs into a small S-size bag quickly." During that time, the man who had been jingling the coins in his pocket reached into his chest pocket as if he had suddenly thought of something. "Based on his attitude, I assumed he would pay using electronic money."
"Good morning! Here's a light breakfast, and a can of coffee that a male customer left behind." Ah, and one more of No. 5 cigarettes. Okay, swiftly pull out Marlboro Light Menthol and scan at the register. "I'll confirm your age by touching the screen. While the man's gaze is fixed on the fast food menu on the screen, I'll stop my finger's movement." "It's okay to ask 'Would you like anything else?' but when the customer seems indecisive about buying, I've decided to step back and wait."
Charli, with a subtle sound of small change, turns her head towards the cash register. People who rustle their fingers in their pockets or palms for small change are often those who are about to buy cigarettes or newspapers, so they are sensitive to the sound of money. A man was standing near the register, holding a can of coffee in one hand and had his other hand thrust into his pocket. Quickly move inside the store, slide your body into the space behind the register counter, and wait inside without letting the customer notice.
The convenience store is filled with sound. The voice of an idol promoting new products over the in-store broadcasting system as the sound of customers entering the store echoes. "The sound of the cashier's voice announcing the price and the beep of the barcode scanner." The sound of putting things in a bag, the sound of a bread bag being squeezed, the sound of high heels walking around inside the store. Everything merges together, becoming the sound of the convenience store, constantly touching my eardrums.
