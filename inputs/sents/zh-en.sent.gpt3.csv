1,一九九三年的那个冬天，对我来说最重要的事，是我爸爸回来了，就在我妈结婚前的那个星期。十二月的一个下午，他到学校来找我。我一路飞奔向大门口，隔着铁栏杆远远地看到他站在外面抽烟。身上穿着一件黑色长风衣，竖起的领子遮住了半张脸。不知道为什么，连他的样子也没有看清，就觉得他过得似乎很不好。我的心一酸，眼泪掉了出来。,"The most important thing that happened to me in the winter of 1993 was that my father came back, just the week before my mother's wedding. One afternoon in December, he came to the school looking for me. I ran all the way to the entrance and from behind the iron bars, I could see him standing outside, smoking. I was wearing a black long coat, with the collar standing up to cover half of my face. For some reason, I couldn't even make out his features, but I could tell that he was not doing well. My heart ached and tears rolled down my cheeks."
2,我没想过我妈妈会有再婚的念头。或许潜意识里，我觉得她应该因为我爸爸的离开而一直痛苦下去，就像我一样。况且，我觉得她缺少那种找到幸福的能力。事实也许的确如此，可是幸福有能力找到她。不是吗，作为一个美人，根本不必那么辛苦，她什么都不用做，只要站在原地就好了。,"I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying. Perhaps deep down, I thought she must have been suffering the same way I was, due to my father's departure. Besides, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness. It may be true, but happiness has the power to find her. Right? As a beautiful woman, she didn't have to work so hard; she didn't have to do anything, she just had to stay in one place."
3,我还记得，那一年的冬天特别长，四月过了一半，迎春花还没有开。父母离婚的事，令你的情绪很消沉。我们好久都没有什么新游戏了，一到傍晚就百无脚赖地坐在死人塔的房顶上。院子里散落的那些身体部件中，又多了几只胳膊。我们用钩子把它们拨到一起，摆成了一个千手观音。,"I still remember that winter was particularly long that year—it was already halfway through April, yet the cherry blossoms hadn't bloomed. The divorce of your parents has taken a toll on your emotions. We hadn't had any new games in a long time, so in the evenings we would just sit listlessly on the roof of the dead man's tower. Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms. We used hooks to gather them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Handed Guanyin."
4,我爸爸其实对做生意一窍不通，只是去投奔一个并不相熟的表哥。我奶奶有个妹妹，早年去了北京，后来在那里结婚生子。这个表哥是她家的长子，在整个家族里，一直作为一个异类存在。,"My father, in fact, had no idea how to do business, but he went to seek help from a distant cousin. My grandmother had a younger sister who had gone to Beijing in her youth and later married and had children there. This cousin of hers was the eldest son in the family, and had always been an outcast in the entire family."
5,刚才你说每个人都有一个起运的时间，人生好像忽然套上了缰绳。我的应该是在八岁。那年秋天，爸爸离开济南，一个人去了北京。从那以后，我就再也没有家了。,"You just said that everyone has a time of departure, and life suddenly seems to be harnessed. I must have been eight years old. That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone. From then on, I no longer had a home."
6,我并不打算赴约。不管是因为什么，我想我们都没有再见面的必要了。我坐在沙发上一支一支地抽烟，天色越来越暗，门突然笃笃地敲响了。送水的男孩扛着水桶站在门囗，说是给西郊的一户人家送水去了。他戴着一顶脏兮兮的灰色毛线帽子，神情恍惚。,"I had no intention of keeping the appointment. No matter the reason, I don't think there's any need for us to meet again. I was sitting on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, when the door suddenly creaked open. The sky was getting darker and darker. The water delivery boy stood at the gate with a bucket of water, saying he was going to deliver it to a family in the western suburbs. He wore a dirty gray woolen cap and had a dazed expression."
7,我们的谈话进行得很艰难。每次陷入沉默，我都觉得心脏受到压迫，只想快点结束这次见面。你似乎有所察觉，但还在努力寻找话题。茶冷下去，屋子里的白雾已经散尽，你终于起身告辞。我刚关上门，感觉松了一囗气，门铃又响了。你站在门囗，请我晚些到小白楼来。我还没有来得及推辞，你已经走出了楼洞。,"Our conversation was difficult. Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being crushed and just wanted the meeting to end quickly. You seem to have noticed, but are still trying to find something to talk about. The tea had cooled, and the white mist in the room had dissipated. You finally got up to take your leave. Just as I shut the door, I felt a sense of relief, but then the doorbell rang again. You stood at the doorway and asked me to come to the Little White Building later. Before I could refuse, you had already left the building."
8,"我走到厨房关掉炉子。水已经蒸发了半壶，整个房间弥漫在白雾里。你局促地坐下来，看着我倒茶。 ""你还跟奶奶和姑姑一起住吗？“你问。 我告诉你，奶奶已经去世了，现在我和姑姑一起生活。 ""她一直没成家“　你问。 ""嗯。“","I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove. Half a pot of water had evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist. You sat down awkwardly, watching me pour tea.  ""Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?"" you asked.  I'm telling you, Grandma has passed away and now I'm living with my aunt.  ""She never got married,"" you asked.  ""Hmm."""
9,你嘴巴里呼出的白色哈气，被风撩起的卷曲头发，大衣下摆底下微微颤动的膝盖，这些让我相信眼前的你是真实的存在，并非是先前那个梦的延续。十八年没见了，认不出来也不奇怪。你没有化妆，苍白的脸有一点浮肿，不过总算没有辜负大家的期望，长成了一个美人。只是那张桃心小脸乌戚戚的，一副在大都市待久了的神情。你问我，你的样子是不是和我想象的不一样。我不置可否地笑了笑。坦白说，我从未想象过你长大之后的样子。对我而言，和你有关的一切都已经装进档案袋，封上了火漆。说出来或许会有些伤人吧，不过，我真的没有期待与你再见面。,"The white breath coming out of your mouth, the curls of your hair being blown by the wind, the slight trembling of your knees under your coat—all of this made me believe that the you in front of me was real, and not just a continuation of the dream from before. It had been eighteen years since we had last seen each other, so it was no surprise that we didn't recognize each other. You had no makeup on, your pale face was a bit swollen, but you still managed to live up to everyone's expectations and became a beauty. Her small, heart-shaped face was filled with a look of desolation, as if she had been living in a big city for a long time. You asked me if you looked different than I had imagined. I smiled, not knowing what to say. To be honest, I never imagined what you would look like when you grew up. For me, everything related to you has been put into a file folder and sealed with lacquer. It may be hurtful to say this, but I really didn't expect to see you again."
10,我睁开眼睛。你站在门囗。我不知道你已经站了多久，没准连我在梦里大笑都看到了。还有醒来的悲伤，最虚弱时刻的样子。程恭，你低声喊出我的名字，声音非常沙哑，似乎已经很久没有开囗讲过话。快要下雪了，天阴得厉害，屋子里黑漆漆的。炉子上的水沸了，咕嚕噜地翻滚着。我仔细地看了你一会儿，确信自己并不认识你。可是在昏暗的光线里，我忽然觉得这个站在对面的陌生人，似乎与我的生命有很深的联结。那种感觉让人背后一阵发凉。我努力回想着，记忆的卡片在头脑中晔啦晔啦地翻动。然后你说，你是李佳栖。,"I opened my eyes. You stand at the threshold. I don't know how long you've been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my sleep. And the sadness upon waking, the look of utmost weakness. Cheng Gong, you called out my name in a low, hoarse voice, as if you hadn't spoken in a long time. It was about to snow, and the sky was dark and gloomy. Inside the house, it was pitch black. The water in the pot was boiling and bubbling. I looked at you carefully for a while, and was certain that I didn't know you. But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that the stranger standing across from me was somehow deeply connected to my life. That feeling gave me a chill down my spine. I tried hard to recall, the cards of memory flipping over in my mind. And then you said, you were Li Jiaqi."
