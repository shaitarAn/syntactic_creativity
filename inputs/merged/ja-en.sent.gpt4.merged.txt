Perhaps because Miho and Satsuki often meet in their hometown, they have strikingly similar expressions and ways of speaking. Their ways of eating sweets are particularly similar, both delicately breaking cookies into smaller pieces with their manicured hands before bringing them to their mouths. I try to remember if it was always like this, but my memory is vague. I sometimes think that the little habits and gestures of the two people we used to be when we met before may have already drifted off somewhere.
Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family home in her hometown, where her friends often gather. Although I sometimes feel reluctant about having to work part-time again tomorrow, it is my only connection with the world outside of the convenience store, and a valuable opportunity to interact with women of my own age in their thirties. Therefore, I try as much as possible to accept Miho's invitations. Today, the group was made up of Miho, Yukari who brought her small children along, Satsuki who is married but doesn't have children yet, and myself. We gathered at Miho's house for tea with a cake we all contributed to.
At that moment, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time. I thought I was born just now. As a normal part of the world, I was indeed born on this day.
For the two weeks leading up to the opening, persistent practice continued with people pairing up, dealing with employees, and addressing imaginary customers. Look into the customer's eyes, smile, and bow; put sanitary products into a paper bag; separate warm items from cold ones; sanitize your hands with alcohol if asked for fast food. There was real money inside the register to get used to handling cash, but the receipt had "Training" printed largely on it, and the other person was a part-time colleague wearing the same uniform. It somehow felt like playing pretend shopping.
My younger sister, two years my junior, was unlike me, a normal child. But that didn't mean she kept her distance from me; rather, she had a deep affection for me. When my sister was being scolded by our mother for something ordinary, unlike me, I approached my mother and asked why she was angry. After the lecture ended because of the question I asked my mother, my little sister always thanked me, as if she thought she was shielded by me. I wasn't really interested in sweets or toys, and often gave them to my younger sister. Because of that, my sister was always following me around.
"Dad, let's grill and eat this today because you like yakitori." I repeated it clearly, wondering if he hadn't heard me well. My mother was taken aback, and the other child's mother sitting next to her was also surprised; her eyes, nostrils, and mouth all opened wide at once. I almost laughed because of the person's strange face, but when I saw them staring intently at my hands, I realized that one wasn't enough. Should I get more? As I glanced at the sparrows walking side by side nearby, my mother, who finally came to her senses, desperately shouted "Keiko!" in a voice that seemed to chide me. Mr. Birdie, let's make and bury a grave for him/her. See, everyone else is crying too. It's sad that your friend passed away, isn't it? Hey, isn't it pitiful? Why? Despite finally being dead. At my question, my mother was at a loss for words.
Put canned coffee, cigarettes, and corn dogs into a small size bag quickly. During that time, the man who had been jingling the coins in his pocket suddenly seemed to have an idea and put his hand into his breast pocket. From that gesture, I instantly judged that they were going to make a payment with electronic money.
Welcome, good morning! With a slight bow, I take the canned coffee offered by the male customer. Ah, one more thing, the number 5 cigarette pack. Understood. Quickly pulling out a pack of Marlboro Light Menthol and scanning it at the register. "Please touch for age confirmation." As I watched the man's gaze smoothly shift to the showcase filled with fast food while touching the screen, I stopped moving my finger. May I take your order? It's fine to ask, but if the customer seems to be deliberating, I make it a point to step back and wait.
I turned around in response to the faint sound of loose change, diverting my gaze towards the cash register. People who jingle change in their hands or pockets are often those who are looking to quickly buy cigarettes or a newspaper and return home, so they are sensitive to the sound of money. As expected, there was a man approaching the cash register with a can of coffee in one hand and the other hand stuck in his pocket. Quickly moving around the store, they slide their body behind the cash register counter and stand waiting inside so as not to keep customers waiting.
The convenience store is filled with sound. At the sound of the chime indicating a customer's arrival, an idol's voice promoting new products flows throughout the store with a piped-in broadcast. The sound of scanning barcodes to the shouts of store clerks. The sound of items being placed in the basket, the sound of a bread bag being clenched, and the sound of heels walking around the store. Everything blends together, becoming the sounds of the convenience store, constantly touching my eardrums.
