Diego Cocca will be the new national coach of Mexico.
In summer 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada, featuring 48 teams for the first time. Cocca takes over as successor to Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old did not count among the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused controversy in the club.
Geesthacht: New signs should encourage reforestation.
Franko Stein (Environmental Department, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nature Conservation Association) are setting up plant signs in the pedestrian zone.
The 'Geesthacht blüht auf' campaign also includes information on what is currently blooming in white and pink.
"Geesthacht" translates to "Geesthacht" in English. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an initiative of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, businesses, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. Goal: In the urban area of Geesthacht, extensive flower islands are to be created where insects can find food at all times. "With favorable weather conditions, bees fly out as early as January to forage for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht Nabu. He has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the initiative is not limited to environmental activists and the city's environmental department, but reaches a wider audience, informative signs about the plants will be placed in private gardens. There are about 50 signs so far. Pedestrians should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is blooming beautifully here. Or, more idiomatically:Pedestrians should be able to find out what's looking lovely here.Or, in a more formal tone:Passersby are encouraged to educate themselves on the current floral displays in this area. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately plant at home.
The wild hare season started during the first week of January.
Younger dates include shrubs such as winter skunk cabbage and winter snowball in the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the earth at the bottom of Bergedorer Street for a year now, showing their first delicate white and pink blossoms and have recently been adorned with additional signs. The winter daphne shrub is quite broad-leafed and can grow up to two meters tall and three meters wide.
The wild hare season started during the first week of January. Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that the beet plants are not the only ones showing flowers now. They bloom particularly lavishly on the right path near the incline, in Gutenberg Street, Wilhelm-Holert-Street, Fahrendofer Way, and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to the Munich East Station!
Every Monday at 3 pm, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively step dance. They are incredibly young at a combined age of 277 years, pardon me!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday. Birthday
For the native Munich resident (born January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is the highlight of the week. Dancing and stomping is my life, without it I can't imagine
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (nearly 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing the night away.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena, Thuringia in 1926. She was a soubrette, today we would say musical performer, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. I have spent my life dancing, acting, and singing.
At 79, Elfriede Widmann is the youngest member of the step dance group. She says: "We're just having fun with our dance teacher Sissy English."
The step dance originated in the 19th century. Developed in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer will thus also become a percussionist. The English expression for it is "tap dance" and the French expression is "claquettes." The Spanish flamenco could have influenced the step dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed, so that they produce a clear, audible sound when dancing.
Sissi Engl, 77, is the soul of the dance studio at the East Station. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family, with us, big and small, old and young are welcome."
"What is the recipe for such a long life?" "I keep myself young through movement," says the 102-year-old to BILD. "My advice to all: exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
"Analog in Dialogue: The Limits of the Digital"
With advancing digitalization, many people are increasingly craving the analog.
The rapid pace at which our daily lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapting our communication and work habits, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden When in 1985 in Bautzen a telephone conversation was to be held, there were three possibilities. Either you were among the six percent of lucky ones who had a private connection. Either you were part of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or he looked for a payphone. The smell of the rubber hose and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling them. I thought, what a wonderful thing that would be!
How far to Moldova?. 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
For that, the 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days. Recean had been one of the President's advisors until now.
After just over a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European government leader was under massive pressure, as she herself explained in her resignation statement, apparently she was targeted by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifices."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. The inflation rate is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, as it holds 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new government leader and his cabinet is unlikely to pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians have become more popular with support from the Kremlin.

"2023 will be celebrated properly in Veitshöchheim again." The fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't hesitate.
State Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Environment and Consumer Protection Minister, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen Chase from the Paw Patrol as his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
Completely out of it: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
President of the State Parliament Ilse Aigner chose no less than "Mama Bavaria" as a role model for her costume.
In the peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the builder, aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He's even playing the sheriff during Carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the move: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to the craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition was naturally not missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party fraction leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
"Wandering is the SPD faction leader's pleasure: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres."
Royal was had by FDP fraction chief Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha arrived as Harry and Meghan.
He will surely speak more otherwise. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the move as a pantomime. At his side, Mrs. Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can always resort to magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.

Oberhof: Kühn Eighth in the World Championship Sprint.
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his fellow countryman Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon who is a TV expert on location is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partial heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already secured a successful title defense.
Few people doubt that number three will follow in the hunt. Bö is once again the clear favorite in the chase. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for shooting errors up to a certain extent with frightening ease.
"At Doll, love is already nothing again." After the veteran had blown his chances of a medal with a poor performance in the mixed relay and had finished a disappointing sixth, he didn't fare any better three days later. Three penalty rounds in the prone position and two more standing were a major disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
He won surprisingly in Hochfilzen six years ago with a narrow margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. One of only three career successes for Dolls, he stood on the podium once this winter. The Olympic champion from Beijing left silently after his poor performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, while the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the value of democracy is at the forefront. Both look back at their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of democratic values during a visit with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," said Biden on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied, looking at his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula won a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government seat in the capital Brasília in January. The violent outbreak in Brazil grimly recalls the storming of the US Capitol over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula criticized Bolsonaro openly during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not prioritize international relations much. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, noon, and night," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied, making an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note on the press of Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? One saw the members of the Red Army Faction who had been cleared for denunciation and elimination.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was openly stirred up against the most dangerous enemies of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say, of bourgeois democracy, let's say, of late capitalist society. "Nothing to worry about here regarding the truly dangerous ones in suits and ties."
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually behind Raudis in the S-Bahnen or Onanists in the park, is coming out with a new edition with Putin's war criminal friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Naturally, the StZ is poorly informed, since there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, rather: Mrs. Wagenknecht is in places 1 to 5 (!), followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Now, I don't know anyone in my surroundings who reads this newspaper. If only, it would be high time now. We have reached the familiar level where nothing is left below.
"And here, no differentiation is necessary anymore."
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth.
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. "Lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, representing Glööckler, confirmed to Bild newspaper and RTL in the same wording." It says there: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application for the dissolution of his life partnership through his family lawyer at the relevant court." "I don't comment on details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there have been rumors of a separation for about a year. According to various media reports, the fashion designer has moved from the shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin after participating in the jungle camp. He also spoke about marriage problems in the RTL show.
"SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead"
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remained, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Macron said, "I have fought for freedom and defended the values of France." Furthermore, he contributed to the German-French reconciliation. The survivor had advocated for German-French youth exchanges, among other things.

"Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be 'absolutely' necessary in the fight against high inflation." The inflationary risks remain significant. "The costs for energy can easily rise again, and China's opening can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row in early February and announced a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The interest rate in the Eurozone is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. Higher interest rates can simultaneously lead to investments being postponed, thereby weakening economic growth.
Even for highly indebted eurozone countries like Italy, rising interest rates are a burden. "The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more severe than higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not deter the ECB from taking decisive action."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the euro area with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been out of reach for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, yet consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than the level of the previous year's month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for a euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are largely driving inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also President of the German Banking Association (BdB). I currently see the greatest danger to the German economy in this. "But I'm optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany tempo" initiative announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. There will have to be a political and societal dialogue about this. "And he may also be a bit controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. I hope that a regulatory framework will emerge that will not be as slow as the previous ones, but also not as rushed as the LNG terminals that were put into operation around the turn of the year.
In the middle of December, after ten months of planning and construction, Germany's first terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to partially close the gap in gas supply caused by the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke about a new "German tempo." Furthermore, the federal government has recently initiated a streamlining of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"It's quite reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters." "That shouldn't automatically mean that we'll always act so categorically and, for example, install a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must always be a negotiation process to determine what society considers right and wrong.
In the past, attempts were made with the classical rulebook and failed. We should reconsider whether our previous approach was correct. "Perhaps we've overdone it with the rulebook and made it too complicated."
"Given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power grids, Hartung does not envy the federal government and the involved companies." As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.
Union warns against breakup of Bayer corporation
The Chemistry Union IG BCE warns of a potential break-up of the Bayer corporation following the announced change in leadership. "From the employees' perspective, Bayer is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future with its three business legs," said Francesco Grioli, member of the executive board of the union and Bayer's supervisory board, in an interview with the Rhineland Post (Saturday edition).
The intended businesses are the pharmaceutical industry dealing with prescription medications, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medications, and the agricultural industry. The transformation of industry can only be achieved with a corporate policy that focuses on risk diversification and sustainability, rather than hedge fund activism.
Background is the CEO change announced on Thursday at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical company. Werner Baumann, the controversial CEO, will step down from his position this summer. Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical chief of the Swiss rival Roche, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The 2018 acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion is still weighing on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkuseners had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into their home. The Bayer stock had been in a downward trend for years. In 2019, the shareholders denied the CEO a discharge of liability at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not seek an extension of his contract, which was actually set to run until 2024. Long-term oriented strategic investors had put pressure on. Lastly, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, including Bluebell Capital, also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the corporation.
The very small fund with unknown participation rate in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. "A spin-off of the Consumer Health division could be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, in an interview with the Rheinische Post. A spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science is not feasible, in his opinion.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris.
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are taking to the streets to protest against the government's plan. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center-right government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, over a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 protesters were counted. A turbulent debate has been raging in parliament for a week over the controversial reform.
Many people in France are already working longer than until the age of 62, if they have not paid enough contributions for a full pension by the time they reach the retirement age. According to the opponents of the reform, people could hardly work any longer in many demanding professions. Furthermore, the employees wanted to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not sacrifice their health entirely for their job.
Macron: Looming Deficit in Pension Fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population ages, employees will have to contribute more to support an increasing number of retirees. To keep the level of pensions stable, the population would have to work a bit more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance.
The government doesn't just want to tighten things up at retirement age. The previously agreed-upon increase in the required contribution period for a full pension should be accelerated. Furthermore, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups should be abolished. The minimum wage should increase to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important initiatives. During the Corona pandemic, the first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and there were already massive protests and strikes back then. Several presidents before Macron had attempted reforms to the French pension system with varying degrees of success, but broad protests and strikes were a certainty for all.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. Some of the deputies themselves from Macron's faction still have reservations. And greater than the fear of a tight vote may be the concern for Macron at the moment is the fear of debilitating strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to ensure that they remained peaceful and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
"Fine weather expected in high altitudes with plenty of sunshine"
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does that mean we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
Offenbach At least until mid-week, calm high pressure weather is expected in Germany. "It will shift slightly to the east over the course of the next week." "It still determines the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. Such a height can even be quite mean and bring gloomy, gray fog to the people in the lowlands for days, while the highlands bask in pure sunshine.
The Sunday starts misty-gray in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can also rain according to the DWD. Especially along the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partially in the west, the cloud cover clears up during the day and the sun appears more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily overcast or covered in high fog. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, up to 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the increasingly strong sun will again gnaw away at the high fog and gradually dissipate it throughout the day," says the meteorologist. Along the edge of the Alps, in the high elevations of the Mittelgebirge, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, full sun is expected all day, while elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high fog layer. The highest values are expected to be between 5 and 9 degrees, while in the Lower Rhine region, 11 degrees are expected. In contrast, only 3 degrees are expected in the long-term gray area in the southeast. There blows weak wind from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may be slow clearing of fog or high fog in some low-lying areas. Otherwise, the weather is showing signs of clearing up after the fog has lifted. In high elevations, in wide parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, and along the Alpine rim, the sun is expected to shine all day long. The temperatures climb according to sunshine to 5 to 11 degrees.Or, more idiomatically:The temperatures rise to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominator struggles: No World Cup medal for Goggia again
The heavily favored Sofia Goggia has shown great disappointment after her exit in the downhill event of the alpine skiing world championships.
Meribel
"I am sad because I didn't deliver the performance I could have," said the Italian woman in ZDF, after she had missed a goal and been eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially severe fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. Four of the previous six season races in this discipline have been won by her. She won silver at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, following her gold medal at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. Goggia, known for her risky driving style, will have to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
Meribel I actually thought I was in a good mood. I am disappointed. I gave everything. "That's just the way life is." Sometimes I believe things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they're not."
"Girl missing in Berlin: Has anyone seen Viktoriya?"
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10th.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information about their whereabouts.
Berlin With the release of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in searching for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the school grounds together with other children at around 12:30 PM on February 10, 2023, heading towards the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very limited German language and local knowledge.

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation.
Paris. Kiev
It was agreed upon during a joint telephone conference to draft a statement aimed at preventing attempts to return athletes from Russia and Belarus to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I have made Germany's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games." "We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Prior to this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian aggressive war, a neutral flag is ultimately stained with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also views Belarus as a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky urges officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to competitions. The president renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said had "unfortunately lost its integrity."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to participate.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior is also taking a stance.
Paris. From our perspective, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to competition. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unrestricted solidarity and support of the international sports community. "The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the interior ministry said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population." Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum. Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics should be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. The IOC aims to return athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that an exclusion based on a passport or birthplace violates the ban on discrimination.

"Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock strongly depleted"
"Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock strongly depleted"
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. The speech is about "half of the main assets."
The Russian army has lost half of its combat tanks in its aggressive war against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the Russian army's main tank force has been destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
Wallander did not provide any additional information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is expected to receive combat tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has agreed to deliver Challenger-2 tanks to Kiev in March. Germany will deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams tanks. Your delivery will likely take significantly longer.
Russia will follow
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitri Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has begged for planes, rockets, and tanks abroad," said Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that for us, in this case, it is self-evident to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks."
A law has been in effect in Russia since last summer that enables a stronger alignment of the economy with the needs of the military. Therefore, individual industries can be obligated to supply the armed forces.Or, more formally:So that individual sectors can be compelled to provide supplies to the military.Or in a more idiomatic English:This way, certain industries can be required to provide materials to the military.
"Controversy surrounding staffing at the army"
For the position that former Director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
"An announcement is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously unfilled position," said the minister. "Speculations of a liberal representative" she does not want to comment on. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. He was confronted with serious mobbing allegations in addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past. These have been cleared from Tanner's perspective.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Orton's substantive suitability. He is an expert on World War I and the monarchies' wars, but the institute focuses on current questions of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner regarding the "unusual ordering process." "The appearance of preferential treatment was decisive," said SPÖ-Wehrsprecher Robert Laimer. The Neos are demanding that Tanner withdraw his appointment. The ÖVP is still "up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, speaker for state defense. He tabled a parliamentary question on the topic.
Carnival: First fools go down on their knees for costs
Thuringia's Carnival hub Wasungen will differ from the state capital during the traditional Fasching procession. However, the higher costs, among other things for safety, are also difficult to manage for the carnival association, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The materials alone accounted for roughly half of the calculated total costs for the move.
No Carnival parades are held in Brandenburg. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, probably Eastern Germany's largest, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht, no parades were cancelled.
Schleswig-Holstein's Carnival high point in Marne remains committed to the traditional parade despite increased costs. "We are canceling our event," said Heiko Claußen, President of the Carnival Society. "Financial worries are also pressing: If we don't find additional sponsors or our current sponsors don't increase their contributions, we'll have to tap into our reserves. That's not sustainable in the long run." The current deficit: approximately 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: "There will be a price increase of up to 60% for some confectionery products, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnacht Association." Through a stroke of luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock left this time. The move will still be more expensive. "Twice as much personnel will be needed for safety as in 2020."
Whoever stands along the roadside during the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland might receive fewer candies than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train passengers haven't had as much.Or, in a more idiomatic English translation:Since sweets have gotten pricier, some train riders haven't had as much. "Whether rain or shine, we can expect a large number of visitors: 'I believe that if it doesn't rain on that day, we can certainly expect an increased number of people', says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne parade leader. 'That's due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years.'" The train is, of course, irreplaceable by nothing.
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. The train is generally "deficient," that's no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Brewed Vodka
The Ukrainians are not known as party animals for nothing. There is domestic beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here.Or, more idiomatically:I keep discovering German beer here.Or, if you want to preserve the play on words with "immer" (always) and "entdecke" (discover):I always find German beer here, it's a never-ending discovery. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I cannot detect a significant difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They are burning mainly on the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it was consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had decreased by an astonishing 80% in five years. Well, you see, it's clear that we can't believe the Russians either. It is said that one should be cautious as a tourist. But that only applies if he goes into mass production. Then it will probably be distorted.

Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof.
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender were greeted by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Upper Court The German biathletes had no part in the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Cup sprint. Yet, there were two rays of light in the fog.
The Federal President tried his best, but from the honorary tribune on Saturday, it was not possible to tell whether the windows on the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to retrieve the results over my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smirk, referring to the thick fog that repeatedly rolled into the stadium, severely impairing the view for the spectators.
Steinmeier still enjoyed visiting the 10km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, where he received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, where Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions." The athletes also thank those who have been working on this since the World Cup was awarded here. "The location is now 'a step ahead' of many others in terms of sustainability and therefore 'secure for the next years and even decades'."
Upper Court Johannes Thingnes Bö from Norway once again outskied the competition. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian four-peat perfectly.
The local ski jumpers were unable to compete for medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the top German athlete with a shooting error and a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. WM-Debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two rays of light behind the gray veil. Benedict Doll was disappointed again. After his botched mixed deployment on Wednesday, the Swabian left five plates standing and disappeared as number 55.
Bö took to the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and demonstrated this status despite difficult viewing conditions. However, he had the luck of the skilled shooter with his last two standing shots; they landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old enjoyed the victory celebration together with his five-year-older brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. With women, German hopes rest on Hermann-Wick. When you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. "There's only full throttle and attack to defend the number one spot," said sports director Felix Bitterling, as he put his "locomotive" team to work. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (13:25 and 15:30 PM/ZDF and Eurosport live).
A swarm of bees has settled on the square.
Felix Brych referee Felix Brych officiates at referee's ball.
Aggressive players or whining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a exemplary function.
Felix Brych, Germany's top referee, has noticed negative trends in player behavior on the field. "I find that there are new behaviors among players that surround the referee like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break." We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. "We will pay closer attention to that and also sanction it."
Lastly, two trainers were also given yellow cards. Bo Svensson, the Mainz coach, saw a red card in the cup loss against Bayern Munich. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. The coach's behavior also falls under unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has increased in this area, and that the behavior towards referees has become slightly more demanding or aggressive. "We will also consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike behavior," said Brych.
Lutz Michael Fröhlich, head of referees for the German Football Association (DFB), emphasized a fundamentally good relationship between coaches and referees. Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected person will have to live with that. "That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly give rise to conflicts during the game." "However, when emotions spill over into personal disparagement, one must also accept that the corresponding measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared things up afterwards. "It would be important if a change in thinking were to take place overall, so that such behavior simply wouldn't be tolerated," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Sports Journalists Association in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects on other levels. . "Of course, incidents from professional football are always blown out of proportion." There is a priming effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," Fröhlich said. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules during the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured the victory after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometer cross-country skiing race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combiners are not entering the Black Forest in their best lineup. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not participating. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which take place from 21. February to March 5th in Slovenian Planica. We have three world-class athletes at home. "The team feels that naturally," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven people injured in car accident on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in a collision involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police statement, there was a chain-reaction collision on Saturday during a minor traffic jam, when a driver rear-ended another vehicle, pushing it into two other cars. The blockage of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg has been lifted after about an hour and a half.
Closing event at the Marl Sculpture Museum
They have brought the exhibition to life: initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, 12th. February, an unusual exhibition comes to an end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the final episode.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12th at 3 pm in the transitional quarter of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings each draw attention to themselves.
After the exhibition, the walls will be repainted, the artworks will disappear. A catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marl Museum. He will be introduced by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag on February 12th.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on community-oriented wall-bound art at the finissage. Using numerous visual examples, she presents the unique features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and explores its connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia, during the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her PhD in 2013 on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic. She has been researching building-integrated art and the history of art and institutions in post-war Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in public spaces in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the final curator-led tour of the exhibition takes place. The artists are on site.
"Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey"
It concerns structural defects that have favored the collapse of buildings. In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued due to possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused should be held responsible for structural defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The state prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. In the course of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued, it was said. According to the allegations, one of the suspects was caught at Istanbul Airport. He is said to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
On early Monday morning, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another magnitude 7.6 earthquake at midday. More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old man died on Saturday night. Fraction leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95 last night, the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing a significant personality, said Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the faction, and former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
Dresden In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first. As Minister President, he oversaw the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR for around 150 days. At the people's chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was followed as the last Prime Minister of the GDR by Lothar de Maizière, a CDU politician, until reunification.
The chairperson of the Left party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short messaging service Twitter as a "deeply genuine and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
He was a highly respected advisor in our party until advanced age, whose wisdom will be greatly missed.
The entire peaceful course of German reunification was indeed a special merit of his. "That will be his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It continues:
His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as Honorary Chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population who did not want to be represented and whose interests were regularly violated.
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 for the PDS and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow has viewed the new state "quite critically." The German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR was absorbed without conditions, and it was condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow has criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened at night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian rocket attacks. Kiev must carry out repairs on the power grid.
Kiev The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks forces new repairs to the Ukrainian energy grid. Even Ukraine is attacking Russian positions. Several heat and water power plants have been damaged, said Volodymyr Kudryzkyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The power supply in the Kharkiv area is particularly poor. Due to instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, while production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plants.
Paris. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with approximately 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror.
Zelensky will not leave the small town of Bachmut behind.
On February 24th, war will have been raging for a year.It will have been a year since the start of the war on February 24th. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The danger from Russian rocket attacks continued into Saturday night. In the capital city of Kiev, the air raid sirens sounded for the fifth time that day late on a Friday evening. "An attack with drones is imminent," the Kiev military administration announced. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German Rail: Federal government selects consultants for network society
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, to split off during the election campaign, failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company that was supposed to be oriented towards the common good in the future. That means she doesn't need to generate profits and distribute them.
80 billion euro renovation backlog
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the federal government accompany this process. The backlog in rail network maintenance is a significant reason why the train service is currently very unreliable. Transportation Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem by completely overhauling entire rail corridors. The investments that are necessary have been estimated at 50 billion euros so far. According to the rail company's latest calculations, they are more likely to be in the range of up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023: Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
Clearly, the external circumstances had not spoken in favor of Herrmann-Wick. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, and was "totally keyed up," her pulse still racing when she arrived. "Such a race" at the home World Cup, "it can't be described in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the thumping pop music, waving German flags, while support staff and team members embraced each other.
"She had decided to enjoy biathlon"
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure was particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Hermann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter as the only German. In the overall World Cup standings, they are currently in fifth place. And even though the performance density among women is significantly higher at the top, with only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominating, one would have expected other candidates for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government: Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. The relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. Back then, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation found refuge in churches. During the protests in 2018, more than 350 people lost their lives. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
"Federal Armed Forces: Armaments industry demands more orders from special funds"
First armament projects have already been cancelled, and further plans are threatened with the same fate, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". "It's not possible to say which investments would be eliminated at this time." "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential cost savings need at the current time," according to a response from the federal government to a query by Member of Parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
Background of the declining investment sum are the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund that the Bundestag resolved in June 2022 must bear the interest burden for the loans itself. These increases mean that less money is available for actual procurements for the Bundeswehr. "Furthermore, the current high inflation rate is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining amount."
Copper Cell: Accident with 3 Injured
On Friday night to Saturday (February 10-11), around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway towards Heilbronn from the Kupferzell on-ramp. At that point in time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling on federal highway B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, according to police reports. During the lane change maneuver of the BMW driver, a collision occurred between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. "An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no defects." Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars sustained a total of approximately 20,000 euros in damages.
Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great even in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world.Or, more idiomatically:The world is focused on the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. More than 200 people gathered on the Stuttgart Palace Square on Friday evening to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque Community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's plea with serious and silent attention. The Imam prayed to Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. He requested, among other things, health, protection from pests, and respectful treatment of one another. The community also requested assistance and strength to bring our aid to the earthquake-affected areas.
"Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria." The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and their families on behalf of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial service. The prayers were also translated into German on the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevite community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations of goods over several days on Glockenstraße, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake regions. The willingness to help was overwhelming there as well.
Hike with meat insert Ebersberg
"After dinner, you should rest or take a thousand steps"... The elders are familiar with the proverb, the young ones simply put it into practice. One way or another, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance during the pandemic years. For those who don't have a home office in the middle of a stone desert but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, woods, and meadows, use their lunch break either for a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At the very least, one could gain this impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 14 o'clock, dog owners are not the only ones having a good time.
A reason could certainly lie in the fact that modern humans, as part of optimal time management, can combine the health-promoting fresh air intake with other activities. Why not take advantage of a short march through nature to learn some news from the long-unseen neighbor during a brief visit to the settlement? Or meet up with the friend who never manages to go to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? "And why can't a meeting with a tax consultant, lawyer, or financial advisor take place outdoors?" If there are no foreign ears nearby, naturally.
One can also excellently acquire natural remedies. Fresh fruit, such as a small cheese plate, stands on a table by the roadside. Potatoes and meat. Only dumb if you haven't thought through the purchase and made the necessary preparations in advance. The elderly couple leaves the wooden salesroom of the farmer in Hinteregglburg with empty hands and regret in their voices. Darn, we forgot the money.
The disappointment is palpable, as one has a companion with a wallet but no means of transportation. What one also lets the sympathetic chance acquaintance know. The man objects: "That's not true! You definitely have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket that was quickly pulled over one's head before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. My wife always packs everything in there!
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat-filled pastry and returns from this midday excursion not only with a leg of lamb, but also with a decidedly practical idea. "Quite possible that a second walk will be necessary after dinner that day." This time, actually, to digestion.
Trapped and severely injured
At around 9:00 PM, the 25-year-old driver was traveling in his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen when he left the road for unknown reasons and veered right off the road while negotiating a left curve, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guardrail, bounced off a tree, and came to a stop several meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire department rescued him with heavy equipment. The rescue service brought the severely injured person to a hospital. Since there was suspicion of intoxication, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. According to the police report, a total loss of 1000 euros was caused by the Audi.
Donald Trump's Tax Returns: A Matter for the Rule of Law.
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must submit the tax returns of the former president to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as President of the United States.
The Finance Ministry must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
In contrast to political norms in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not disclose his tax return either as a candidate or later as president. He fought all the way to the Supreme Court against the release. A district attorney's office in New York has received the documents, but no details can be made public except if it leads to a trial.
The release to Congress is likely to be a delicate matter for Trump. There, the circle of authorized individuals is somewhat larger, and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, welcomed the decision immediately as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the tax documents of the Republican is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and the undermining of our security as President," Pelosi declared.

British serious criminal arrested in Thailand after long flight
A convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been arrested in Thailand after five years on the run. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's most wanted list of most sought-after criminals.
The leader of a criminal group fled before the start of a trial in early 2018, according to authorities, in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison in absentia for attempting to smuggle amphetamines worth £8 million (€9 million).

Cabaret Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and claims to love the Viennese sense of humor, is using his cabaret programs to champion science. The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again," fits the bill. Whether this fits well into the generally prevailing domestic skepticism towards science, let it be left undecided. His humor fits in very well with Vienna.
The English title is also derived from Ebert's younger life story, as he attempted to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. The target text includes an English translation of the source text but it has a wrong interpretation. The term "Wissenaft" is mistranslated as "science fiction". The correct translation should be "science". So, the final correct English translation will be: Now he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what science actually is and what it can and, above all, cannot do. Of course, Corona is also coming, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering skill.
And he boils it down to the most important question that many people push aside: What is truly important? The whole thing with a huge wink, unperturbed and very ironically. And so you'll not only be well-entertained, but you'll also learn something.

General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector oscilloscope monitor. This game depicts the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles will be fought in a wide valley, completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley, there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that provide temporary protection to the player, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving armored vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile rockets that become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. Additionally, UFOs appear periodically. "These cannot attack the player's tank." The player can achieve a high score by being hit by a UFO. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game start-up sequence, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test sequence. The latest operating mode represents a special procedure for checking the control elements and computer functions.
Gameplay
Gameplay The LED switch stays lit and the game sounds become audible. The game ends when the last player's tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that appear on the screen. The player can determine the position of the enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left corner of the cockpit's heads-up display. Additionally, a point is visible on the wide-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the lower screen. "If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to aim at on the screen." "Enemy in the firing range will be simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display."
Gameplay Occasionally, UFOs are visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are safe flight bodies that observe the combat situation and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are supposed to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot by the player earns them 5,000 points. "If an opponent is hit, the following points are achieved:" For a slow-moving tank, 1,000 points; for a rocket, 2,000 points; and for a super tank, 3,000 points. A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Furthermore, upon reaching predefined point thresholds, a bonus tank can be unlocked and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more challenging gameplay experience. The exact switch positions and details of the gameplay mode selector for this setting can be taken from the illustration.
Initial input at highest levels
Gameplay If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of highest scores, they can enter three (3) personal initials at the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply will erase the table of highest scores. When resetting (RESET), the ten highest scores with their initials are retrieved and redisplayed on the screen to challenge other players. Each point score above 100,000 will be additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write strokes. "Construction Order"
New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you have already had experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The steering lever. This is a re construction of the Atari joystick. He was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, which made this unit more stable and ensured proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly returns the control lever to its central position. The microswitches are now, for easier replacement, attached with self-locking nuts. B. Two PCBs. ATARI'S X/Y-axis switching was extended to two (2) interconnected printed circuit boards. These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a uniform and calm image. C. The power supply unit. Battlezone is equipped with a newly constructed power supply. It features a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased energy supply provided by the circuit expansion. The device casing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device features a console designed for younger players as a footrest to facilitate gameplay. Simultaneously, this console ensures maximum equipment stability at the installation site.
The new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are depicted in Figure 1. "If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you'll find this symbol." Equipment inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should conduct a certain review to round off the quality control. To ensure that the device is delivered to you in good working condition, the following checks should be performed: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V grid yet. Investigate damage to the outer housing. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside as follows: (1) Check all cable connectors for proper and secure connection. Potential open or
NOTE: Never forcefully establish plug connections. The connectors are equipped with a forced guidance system, ensuring a correct connection. A 180-degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Verify that the connector connections to the game PC board are properly seated and secure. Note the device's serial number on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the entered production number matches the production numbers of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, Auxiliary PCB, Regulator/Audio II PCB, and TV monitor. A picture of the location where the serial number is affixed can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your specialist dealer for additional service information. (4) Check all other major components such as the power supply, control panel, and TV monitor for flawless installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a glance through the player's sight glass, it can be verified whether the radar screen is also situated in the bright, orange-circled aperture of the cover. If the opening is not precisely centered, the cover secured with adhesive tape on the housing must be loosened and repositioned. Before the device is connected to the power grid, it must be ensured that the voltage selector switch on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and control the connection values as listed below:
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Here are some tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games: Checking the system configuration.

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ON Fahrenheit
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new range of possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression that could push the boundaries of the world. She presented me with an opportunity to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century. "Centuries ago" I struggled with the still unrefined technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover, especially a new language that was both narrative and visual. To be quite honest, the next ten years didn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were only utilizing a tiny part of their incredible creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental aspect of human experience: emotions. Meanwhile, technology was making rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, emotion-conveying medium. Even if it could have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is still the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that goes beyond simply fighting disgusting monsters in dark corridors and scavenging for ammunition on crates. It offers far more complex and deeper content. It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will contribute to changing your mind about them. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything for the first time. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a significant part of our lives and presented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, repeatedly challenging us to question many of the principles we had previously considered unshakeable. I would be delighted if Fahrenheit had a similar lasting impact on you, like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you, without disappearing from your memory completely. David Cage

Service Program
General.. For programming and testing, the 4 switches located on the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the video PCB are used.
Programming Announcement With this ad, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and game work is selected. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language appears green, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. "Deployment programming" With this ad, the difficulty level for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" can be set that may be available at the start of the game. The font size will be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test-" switch (which appears green), and the desired value for this line will be programmed using the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory, etc. Basic settings achieved when the bottom line (RESET line) glows green, press the 'Up' switch. The values are reset, the pointer (also referred to as the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program announcement. "Back" (Reserve High Score value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs to have their initials (name) and hit points displayed on the screen. The "credit limit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptor is blocked by a coin jam. As a result, a limited number of games can be set for a player. This value is from 199. He should not be set so close to 99 that the credits cannot be reduced to zero by inserting a coin, when more than 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Highest Credits" to O. "Additional programming: Number of games: Number of bookmarks per credit"
"Threshold: Height of the percentage number that must be reached to switch to the next gear."
"Time limit: Approval for additional sparks"Or, more idiomatically:"Deadline: Approval for extra sparks"
Gameplay
"Anziehton": bei "0" kein Ton bei Standbetrieb can be translated as "No tone at standby".
"1" Ton also includes a standing operating mode (animated model) "Tabletop": "0" stationary device
"1" table device.
The interest rates per coin are set on the "Coin Insertion Programming" display. "High-Score Program Display (Best Hit Rate So Far)" The player's hit points and initials appear, including the 10 subsequent point numbers. The values are used to set the high score based on the previously displayed selection (set back). By pressing the "Up" button, the QIX standard initials are set. With pressure on the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Assessment" By pressing the "Up" button, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of paid credits. The total number will not be set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts over from the beginning. The total number can only appear on 0 when the battery or the W1 plug connection is removed, with the device turned off. "Number of coins inserted into the left coin slot." "Middle coins: (not available) Right-hand coin slot: Number of coins inserted into the right coin slot." "Paid credits: Number of credits given for owned (exchanged) coins." "Guaranteed credits: Number of credits granted by the device." % Free Spins: Granted Credits (Paid + granted credits per 100) Played Minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in extended or won game. Leisure time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game duration in seconds: Played minutes/paid + granted credits.
"High Score (Trefferquote): Number of players who had high hit rates enough to push other players out of the high score list." By activating the "Up" switch, the values are reset to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display will appear.
"Coin slot programming/normal cash setting" With the help of this display, the operator can select a standard coin setting or program another setting.
A standard setting is provided, whereby pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons selects the programming while the top digit glows green on the screen. The sizes change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted. "If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be adjusted by activating the 'Sub-Test' switch." After a single press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that own setting is possible. Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting is made, any new quantity can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. The default setting appears when pressed accidentally. The values can be increased or decreased using the "Up" and "Down" switches. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is terminated. The coin multiplier ("Coin Unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted into the associated slot. "Credit units" display the number of required units before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued.Or, more idiomatically:"Bonus" coin units display the necessary units prior to issuing a bonus credit. "Min.-Münze" is a value that accumulates credits until a predetermined minimum amount of coins is reached. With standard settings, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (Storage) OUTAGE
When "Memory Failure Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default settings. This state likely indicates a failure or defect in the battery.
Troubleshooting and Settings
Start of the testing method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display by pressing the "Test" button, which will display the next program. Is a durability test of the video board desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto test mode. The device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off. When the display shows "Open Coin Door to Test", program plug J 19, 1 2 must be inserted. With the power plug removed, J19 protects the memory (storage) and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware Tests: The following tests are conducted:O = out / I = in / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the stored checksum for that ROM. Is a difference present, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. When the checksum ROM is faulty, U10 is displayed first. If this test does not pass, the next ROM displayed on the LED screen must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Video Board Communication RAM
The Communications RAM Test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 When Gerdt with the o.a. "Display holds, an error was detected." The communication RAMs falling during the video board test can be caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or errors on the data board. To localize the error, remove Data Board P6 and repeat the test. A failure means: errors in the U3, U4, or associated power circuits.
Video Board Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Random Access Memory
After values have been written to another part of memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. The test was passed, all memory locations will be reset to their previous values. LED value: 00 0011 When the device holds the aforementioned display, an error is present. Check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuitry in this case.
Check video board color RAM by storing predefined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy upon reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error has occurred. Check U 56, U 57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Advertisement RAM) The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these inscriptions will be compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy brings the program to a halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. When a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. Does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is displayed that the next test will begin (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived in 2 days with Amazon logistics. That's also the reason for Star Number 1. The second one ensured that the right jacket arrived without visible sewing defects. BUT I had been looking forward to this jacket too much, so the disappointment was all the greater. I ordered the jacket in size L based on the other reviews. Since they sit so close together and I didn't want to struggle into a S or M with my overhead... In the end, she would have fit in terms of length and hip size...in the rest, I could swim. Moreover, the lining material came pouring out of the package as soon as it was opened and spread all over the place. Just plain sad... She will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good processing. One can wear them well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she's completely thrilled. She otherwise wears the 158 and the 36 fits her well in this case, and she will likely wear it again next year. We can recommend a order.Or, more idiomatically:We can recommend placing an order.
Robust Quality
I decided on the rubber mat C because I always work with wood on the tail lift and that's not optimal. Unfortunately, I have mismeasured and the size doesn't fit quite right. What is my mistake, however. Then I slightly adjusted it to make it fit. The edition is very robust and no longer damages the edges. You can use the nut or the whole area. Worked without any problems. "Nothing is slipping away anymore." I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately, too large for under 1 year.
The product itself is okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is far too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it due to size. Now with 12 months, we've searched him out again and he can use him. He still hasn't been able to bite anything with his few existing teeth. And when he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down very much.
"Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, it's going back"
I was blinded by the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. I would like to mention that I already have two Lowepro backpacks in use. A large one for storing equipment and a small one for everyday essentials that you might need to take with you. As a result of my recent purchase of the Sigma 70-200 2.8, my small Lowepro bag has become too small and I need a replacement. I purchased this backpack for a very reasonable price (just under 29 EUR) during Prime Day and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, disillusionment followed. The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices .... People, that's just not right! I had really hoped that it would be that way, but there's no way it can be.Or, more informally:I had really been hoping for that, but no way it's gonna happen. The padded walls are significantly thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations within, are of a different caliber, much more difficult. Overall, the haptics of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly high quality either. Therefore, I have decided that the backpack is going back. When I invest in equipment worth many thousands of euros, I unfortunately also have to spend money on a decent backpack. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, a backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I like is the color inside. One will certainly find their things much faster with a clear conscience than with a gray inner life. For someone who has different expectations for a backpack, it's certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part.
I had previously enjoyed the Electricity series by E. L. Todd the most, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books to be very strong and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part. In that part, it's all about Volt and Taylor's feelings, and I found it unnecessary to drag it out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is then like a small child during every argument, getting all upset?!. At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor would stand up for him and try to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and struggles with Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would add more tension to the story again.
God Human destroys everything, doesn't know how to appreciate, and doesn't learn from it! First of all: The movie isn't that bad, as many people say. Clearly, the story is completely fabricated, and repeatedly conceived according to the same F schema. "When you've seen the beginning, you know how it will end." And the message is always the same: Humanity destroys everything and doesn't appreciate anything, and doesn't learn from it! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! Therefore, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals, the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of habit and greed, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: Error message. "4 stars because the film is well-made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars." Despite the good popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film.
Some people expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be one either. This film is predominantly "French" besides being calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and brings one to tears when one allows oneself to be immersed in it without any preconceptions.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter. Five days in a row, every morning a package: nothing has moved, but not a thing. My waistline has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! "After that, I had diarrhea 5-8 times a day." Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been persisting for a week now. It is worth noting that only 2 stars were given (unfortunately, only noticed too late) for the smaller packaging size, while the larger size received a full 5 stars. That's very very strange!
Awful stench and poor results! I dyed my blonde hair a deep brown in October with a hair dye, and in February/March, I used a hair color remover. I have applied the product twice. The first time I noticed it, it struck me that it smells terrible! However, the result was not entirely unsatisfactory, as it turned out to be a shade of brown similar to chestnut (but slightly darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it again, as instructed in the manual for unsatisfactory results. "This time it was pure time wasting!" It didn't make a difference, my hair looked the same as in the first attempt. The worst part was that it still stunk for weeks after application. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, and one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin D levels had been in the cellar for a longer period of time due to my job, lack of exercise, and a longer additional illness. I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 supplements. This works very well too. I feel fitter and significantly better. I sleep better and get up better from bed. The price is also great, but you have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not entirely foolproof !! After three months of using the battery, I have discovered the following major drawbacks, which I find very annoying: The shell has had trouble connecting with the phone over time. This means that the device will not turn on even though the 'Power On/Off' button has been pressed for 3 seconds. When one removes the phone from its case and reassembles it, they solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new issue. Through frequent removal and reinsertion of the phone into the case, the lid has become so worn out that it now detaches from the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times. "There may not be many major flaws, but I still find that a battery-powered shell should function flawlessly in its intended function, and therefore I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I've only been using it for 3 months, and it cost me 30€."
"Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing"
I don't know how these excellent reviews come about. It's actually just a microfiber cloth for cleaning glasses, which you can get in a slightly smaller size as a gift at any optician's. The cleaning effect is just as good as with a dish towel and no better. I had expected much more from these towels, it's really very, very thin. I used it, so I can't exchange it anymore. I'm disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is way too high, you shouldn't pay more than 2 euros for them.
I doubt the frequency range.
I bought this shower speaker for myself since my small free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. The Onforu works great overall, it's waterproof (I've taken it in the shower), it has good bass, Bluetooth works well... The suction cup needs to be moistened, otherwise it won't stick, it can play sound very loudly... yes, what I see as a criticism is the frequency response of this small speaker. As said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are almost felt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are still clearly audible. My old speaker may not have reproduced the bass very well, but the frequencies were depicted quite naturally in terms of volume.Or, more idiomatically:My old speaker didn't have great bass, but it did a good job of reproducing frequencies at natural volume levels. "Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying." Therefore, I have to take a star off. I expected more from the frequency range.
very bad
At a few spots, the color had peeled off and when you just ran your hand over it, the color would also come off at other spots. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts, but as if both commodes were damaged. Poor service from manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded our money. A praise for Amazon
"Spend a little more money"
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered that need to be assembled by yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. The mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, damaging a few templates.Or, more formally:The postman inserted the product into my mailbox in such a way that a few templates were damaged. I didn't criticize it, because I badly needed this product. The provided adhesive barely holds, but it sticks like chewing gum and doesn't harden. Already a day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material had not dried (at least it was still not dry after 5 days), one must be very careful not to stick everything together. The templates are partially punched out incompletely. For a one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + beautiful design + stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned freely
Doors slam shut with magnets (maybe can be adjusted with rubber plugs) some unsightly spots.
The provided dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and I also didn't have a cup in the house, so I glued them in place with craft glue) The fittings for the shelf are a bit wobbly (I wrapped them with paper and balanced them out) "Conclusion: If he didn't look so good and didn't have such good measurements, I would give him fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit perfectly to be truly satisfied." Moreover, I find him a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me...but
...there are only three stars. The taste is subjective, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow evenly (if at all!).. The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) means a deduction of one star for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and scores full points soon.
"Geht mir auf den Wecker" translates to "It gets on my nerves."
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are terrifying, and extremely loud to boot. I couldn't turn her down either. Probably a defect, allegedly possible. The quietest radio setting was still too loud for me, so I immediately fell out of bed. "Moreover, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast a shadow on the wall with your hand." I always woke up when I had turned my face towards the alarm clock, because I thought it was already morning. When it finally came to that and the sunrise simulation began, it was suddenly too bright for me. The colors and the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately, one cannot dim the colored light. I also found it good that he has a battery, so that the clock and alarm time do not need to be re-entered in case of a power outage. However, I went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing unsatisfactory
I have replaced four light sources in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket instead, a plate laughs at me at this spot... There was nothing in the carton. "6 pays 4" is not a good deal. Amazon should have definitely taken care of it quickly and easily, but I only realized it after the return deadline had passed. Therefore, I see it as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indicator of the quality of these lighting fixtures that the only reason for a two-star deduction so far has been. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color tends towards cool white. Perfect for hallway, office, workshop, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I would personally opt for warmer lighting. "Certainly comparable to a good old 100 watt light bulb." Other lamps can do that too, and maybe I'll even get intact samples there corresponding to the order. Should my assessment be of help, I am pleased about a positive assessment.Or, more idiomatically:I'm happy to help with my assessment, and I appreciate a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Fantastic!
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first glance. Yes, positive. I have long considered whether to order this set or not. The material is stable and it feels good in the hand. The utensils all have a hole in the handle so they can be hung up. The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical for use on coated pans. They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. You don't pass on the heat and thus can be touched directly. The dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But shortly after wiping and they're gone. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend.
"B-Ware sold as new"or"B-Ware passed off as new"
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, the water faucet disassembled and all parts checked.Or, more idiomatically:Then the shock, the faucet disassembled and all parts inspected. Here, we found that the part had already been assembled before. We have observed significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The connections/joints of the hoses were all damaged. Despite that, we have installed the part into the washbasin (unfortunately). Only now did we notice that scratch marks/streaks are also visible on the chromed water faucet itself. This part was probably delivered and returned before. We'll keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion We'll never order such goods from Amazon again, instead we'll pay a bit more at the hardware store where we get decent quality. I find it simply depressing that customers are being ripped off like this!!!
Product excellent, outdoor sensor unfortunately defective after 6 months.
Fundamentally, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation went very smoothly, and the range is also very good, with no problems whatsoever with transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple in design and can either be mounted on the wall or stood up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after approximately. While the thermometer still appears to be intact, it continues to display plausible values. The hygrometer is probably broken, as it consistently displays completely astronomical values for outdoor humidity. That's a shame, as the device was installed in a protected location and that's also why I can only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catcher
"Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still roaming around today with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service in triggering a replacement delivery was, as always, outstanding." The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression. The engine is powerful and it results in a beautiful cutting image. The volume level is not particularly impressively low, but okay. Big drawback is unfortunately the cage. He is made of hard plastic on the top and bottom and fabric in between. When you only briefly set it down when full, it will naturally get compressed and parts of the content will fall out. Worse yet, the practical fill level indicator already shows red at half capacity. That wouldn't be so bad, if the mower didn't keep losing large parts of the cutting material. The solution cannot be to empty the basket at a large grassy area when it is only half full. Therefore, I have cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. "In conclusion, a very good mower overall, but unfortunately rendered unsuitable for me due to the poor design of the catch basket."
Good surveillance device
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. Very good is the included detachable sensor cable, which can also be extended when needed. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery life, they are only displayed once or three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I can only give 4 stars. The soft back panel of the device, which also covers the battery compartment, can only be closed awkwardly again. One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses its network connection every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect on its own, even when placed near the router. One must remove the batteries and pause briefly before reinsertion, and it will connect again. That should actually work without removing the battery. There's always an alarm when the connection is lost. The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer
I have ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level my hotbed properly until today. The rear mounting screw on the right is completely tightened, yet the bed is still too high and the screw falls out forward, even though it is not tightened, because the bed is still too low. The poles that hold the wagon are straight, as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it's impossible to print anything like this.Or, more idiomatically:Perhaps someone has an idea what to do, since it's impossible to print this. For assembly: The assembly was relatively problem-free, one could only show how to lay the cables properly to avoid having to re-lay them multiple times, which is very tiring. I have also written support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response. "Unfortunately, sending it back is not an option anymore." "I had expected a bit more."
"Robust and precise, I am positively surprised."
My old caliper has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed. This one makes a very robust impression and has been proven to be just as precise after multiple testing. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the scraper leaves no wishes unfulfilled and has all necessary measuring methods at its disposal. I can only give him full marks for that and I believe he'll last at least as long as the old measuring instrument. "There is a clear buying recommendation and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household."
Disgusting, persistent smell.
I bought the armband and haven't worn it yet, because it emits a disgusting smell. The smell has not gone away until today, even though it has been "aired out" constantly. After it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. "Rate vom Kauf ab" translates to "Advise against the purchase" in English.
Okay for the price.
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too large for my personal taste, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice again. However, the kettle is overall very simply constructed, so I have already opened the lid twice.. I've been able to repair him every time so far, but I think that won't last much longer. "You can't expect anything really high-quality for a low price."
Very beautiful piece of jewelry.
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds! One only needs to pull the end through one's mouth, it cannot rise, amazing! I have treated it with some leather care, which makes it softer and more pliable. Only those with something magnetic on their arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was disappointed even after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was in order. Now for the function: It only connects after some fiddling... doesn't work at all when following the instructions, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it did the senders finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, as the connection was lost again after only an hour, even though the transmitters were right next to the base station. The announcement of the three senders was also very different! "Everything is completely useless to me!"Or, more idiomatically: "Everything is utterly useless for my purposes!" The thing went back! "I would definitely advise against buying it, it's nothing but trouble!"
Transport damage
Transport damage Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft had rusted after 3.5 years. I only bought it again for one reason: I urgently needed it because of the current drought, and I knew the connections of the suction hose and the drain would fit. I hope that the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will last longer. The cardboard was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in the future, rather than just using a thin cardboard box. I kept the pump despite the cracks in the plastic housing, as described above, because I urgently needed the pump and the cracks did not affect the pump's performance.
One could have thought it through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I find it more convenient to have an organizer rather than carrying a huge key ring around all the time. At first, everything went well. However, the paint job didn't last long and the screws had to be tightened repeatedly. Nice that it also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now let's get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: the key handover. "Nice that one can adjust the screw in different parts to different sizes." One should first disassemble the whole thing using a wrench before trying to stretch it, otherwise one will need pliers to take it apart again. The act of putting the key in itself is simply a game of patience, balance, and dexterity. Finally, the screw broke off in the thread during the third attempt at assembly, rendering the entire thing unusable. "In conclusion: If at all, then only once for all the necessary keys, and never again, but at that price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative."
Do not quite match the specified dimensions.
Easy-to-use zippers, the material feels robust, and it's all in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to truly evaluate the product after its first use. I can already say that the height is lower than stated in advance.Or, more idiomatically:The height is actually lower than advertised. At the moment, I can't really imagine it yet, everything there, for example. In case of an emergency, the really big parts can also be placed directly into the trunk as before. Note that 10 parts were delivered instead of 8, as the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller pouches/tubes. "Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway."Or, more idiomatically in English:"Not high-quality processed, I still wanted to bring it up."Or in a more formal tone:"Despite the lack of high-quality processing, I felt it necessary to mention this." The fact that the cosmetics bag has a different color tone and is made of different material than the other bags does not personally bother me. The price-performance ratio, I see it as a trial price, and that's okay.Or, more idiomatically:The price-performance ratio seems reasonable to me, and that's fine.
"So silly", "So foolish", "So nonsensical", "So absurd"
"Also, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas." Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it anymore. Battery? "Getauscht" translates to "Exchanged" in English. But he still doesn't work properly. I could have thrown the money directly into the trash can too.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful when approaching the needle to avoid damaging it. I couldn't hear an improvement in sound quality from my very high-end record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables. Battery life lasts very long. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I have found that the headphones are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and do not cause any pain. The earplugs are completely soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also very low. "Recommendation for purchases in this price range."
Nice dress
Very beautiful dress that is versatile and suitable for various occasions. Price-performance ratio is spot on here, especially since I also got it on a flash sale. It fits me perfectly in size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as it was recommended). I would have wished that the cut wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could handle a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slender upper arms as the model in the picture). Overall, a stylish dress for many occasions.
"Keep your fingers away", "Don't touch" "Things can't get any worse." I would not have expected in good faith that such junk is being sold nowadays. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB connections provide sufficient power. Despite this, a fault-free operation of this hardware is not possible. DVDs play normally, Blu-rays are recognized with varying degrees of reliability. The discs must be inserted multiple times, and then it makes grinding noises like those not heard since the 90s from old PCs and the earliest CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing is happening anymore or the disc will finally be recognized. Then, one must not press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the film, or do anything else. "That leads immediately to an irreparable freeze." "Furthermore, no Blu-ray software is included." When one purchases PowerDVD or similar additional software, the price of this device doubles.
"Do what you have to do, but it's not nice." First and foremost, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually misleading, since only the port facing upwards is a genuine USB port. The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and would have been fine with a cheap extension, but I certainly wouldn't have bought this awkward lump with golden connectors. "However, setting aside its appearance and my initial misgivings, the extension has performed its duty very reliably." And the weight of the plug means that the inserted USB stick doesn't dangle freely in the area like a regular extension cord. Not a real mistake, but my euphoria is limited :-).
Small but oh! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With iOS 12, you can now transfer data back and forth. This works very well. The audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I had to send back could not do this unfortunately.Or, more idiomatically:Other adapters that I had to return were unable to do this, unfortunately. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to my tablet and the HDMI connected to my TV. Simultaneous loading is no problem. "Ton" will be delivered over HDMI. What do I still need my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter that could be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. "My cover doesn't fit with the adapter." "Yeah, it's definitely safe and has contact from there..." Everything is a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. Additionally, it's very small and made of aluminum for added stability. Price-performance ratio fits.
A lot of performance.
Top device Has been running smoothly for months. It's not exactly easy or quiet, but it brings decent performance. I find the medium temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen onto the tile floor multiple times and survived well. And the simple design pleases me too. Competitor products would love to look like spaceships.Or, in a more idiomatic English translation:Competitors' products often aim to look like spaceships.
Very good
The brush head's processing has made a very good impression, despite the significant price difference compared to the original, which does not give a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can highly recommend them without reservation.
Fantastic!
We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. The live mode location is accurate to within 0.5 meters. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump around a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy him again anytime. What would be really great would be a battery that lasts longer. He currently holds out for around 1.5 days. "Here's a solution that would take 7-14 days to implement." There is indeed an XL version, but unfortunately it's too large for our taste, the battery wouldn't last long and we would find it impractical to have to change it every day. One should occupy oneself with the dog, not its collar. The app worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, trash.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable. The lifespan is decreasing steadily. Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole is already worn out after just a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. During normal use, the last pair didn't last very long either, but I thought it would be sufficient for the lesson. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly but original? My last pair of Crocs finally broke after 5 years, so I'm eagerly awaiting my new order. These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. They are as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference is apparent, but upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel is loose and unlikely to last five years like my previous ones. I am excited!
Surprisingly good
There were hardly any reviews available, so I was initially very skeptical. Since I'll be attending a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I've booked it on a whim. The delivery scope included a mattress and an electric air pump. To the mattress: I have laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing purposes. . English Translation: "While I was translating, I noticed that there is mold on one page." I wiped it off and hope that it won't resurface again. In the excited state, a lie detector test was conducted directly. Or, more idiomatically: A lie detector test was carried out immediately while he was in an excited state. It lies well and fits perfectly for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for a few days at the event, it's pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We removed the seats from the back before. Therefore, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found at the pump. The pump will be stuck into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). My friend's handyman skills allowed him to repair it and once reassembled, the good piece worked excellently, inflating the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the hardship test at the festival. I hope she doesn't lose air and also lasts a long time. Similarly, that he doesn't show up again.. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
very bad Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. For fast delivery. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar has been torn open directly from day 1 through several flaps due to careless processing. On the 21st, there were no more doors left, and I had to more or less allow my son to remove the remaining parts as well, since they were practically falling off already. The parts often come loose, which means that you have to disassemble the car again to get the parts in. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off during play. Mostly the windshield. I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. The manufacturers may reconsider the design of the calendar for the next edition and make it better.
a real drone
I am thrilled by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it. Inside, the very good one flies and the 5 minutes. Flight time is usually sufficient. I didn't expect anything else at that price, but the drone's propellers getting tangled in hair and breaking quickly is not a problem. Crashing from the ceiling to the ground, whether it's tiles or carpet, is no issue. "Please feel free to contact us for any questions."
"Game okay but only playable with forced Steam connection." I did not see when buying that it was not a game CD but only a code that allows you to download the game. That would be tolerable, but you're forced to install Steam to play it at all, which is outrageous. Ever since then, the computer keeps crashing, which wouldn't be the case with a clean installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was looking forward to the watch very much.Or, more idiomatically:I was really looking forward to the watch. "Design and optics great, news etc. displayed without any issues." "The bedside table worked well... and yet I'm sending it back." The big hook: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, just lying on the shelf overnight, and 11% less battery in the morning without use. Many messages came during the day, and the battery was already dead by midday/early afternoon, and then you couldn't even read the time anymore. Therefore, not useful for me. Very sad.
Noble shell with limitations
One should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I have recently come to appreciate sleeves that can also accommodate a credit card. This offers the shell here.This provides the shell here.The shell is available here. When you put cards in all three slots, it's too much, then the lid stands a little high. One is enough for me. The leather sleeve makes a robust impression and seems to be well-crafted. She looks noble. The phone is embedded in contrast to many other shells around it, with cutouts only at the connections. Otherwise, the on/off switch and volume control can be easily operated through the housing on the sides. "Disadvantageous is that it is not possible on some QI charging devices to charge the phone through the thickness of the case." Even at the TORRO leather charging station, it doesn't work. Accessories like the Galaxy Buds can only be charged when the case is empty. Otherwise, really chic and well-made!
High-quality case with armor glass film.
Robust case with proper armor glass as screen protection in a classic design offers all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is pleasant to the touch and does not soil. A truly successful and beautiful product with an excellent price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some stability.Or, more idiomatically:This case provides support for the phone. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
