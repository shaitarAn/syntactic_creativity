The boundless sea noise did not stop for a minute.
He ran in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
And the wind would start rustling in the bare trees, then go quiet, just as I was listening to the flow of the night.
But he didn't leave, he was here.
I knew this by the smell of wet pebble and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf.
I noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
Occasionally, rifle shots echoed out of the darkness, out of the city.
After each shot, the dogs barked for a long time.
Then a dim light flickered far out at sea and went out.
He made us look at these things more closely and longer than we usually do, and discover many qualities in them that we had not noticed before.
Yes, in the porous yellow stone, there were many small sea shells firmly embedded in it.
On the rockrose bushes, there were still a few flowers left; they sat on straight firm stems like soaked and shriveled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
But it very rarely appeared in the fog as a blurred white spot, providing neither warmth nor shadow.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon spots on the trunk, leaves lay as if cut out of dull green velvet.
Through the iron gate, ants ran in a line, carrying their last reserves for the winter to their underground granaries, and a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
At night, on the other side of the river, someone started waving a lantern and shouting loudly.
I went to the shore with my uncle Ilko.
The river roared.
The water flowed over the dam in a cold waterfall.
The night was late, deafening, not a single star overhead.
The face was blasted with the wild freshness of the expanse, of the thawed earth.
And all the time someone on the other bank waved a lantern and shouted, but the words couldn't be made out over the noise of the river.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses unharnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black mourning attire.
She stood motionless on the shore.
She saw from there as they took her father away.
Then she knelt down and fell headfirst into the sand.
No, the grandfather replied.
That's true, we haven't seen each other.
Ostap began to lose his sight.
He decided then to go all the way to St. Petersburg to see that woman before he completely lost his sight.
He reached the imperial capital and found out that she had died, presumably unable to bear the separation.
Ostap found her gravestone of white marble in the cemetery, he looked at it and his heart broke.
His iron rose lay on the stone.
<ERROR>
Forever.
And Ostap started to sing limericks and, presumably, died on the road or at the market under a cart.
Amen!
On that shore, the countess Branicka's protected forest rose up the slope.
The sun could not break through the dense greenery of this forest.
Only occasionally a solitary ray cut through the thicket at an angle, revealing to us the stunning power of vegetation.
Like sparkling specks of dust, little birds flew into this ray.
They squealed as they chased each other and dove into the foliage, as if it were green water.
I was filling a bucket with water from the pond, throwing grass into this water, and waiting.
The red floats stood motionless in the water.
Then one of them would start shivering, would make light circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim aside.
Father was reeling in, the fishing line was tightening, the walnut rod bent into an arc, and over the pond in the fog there began a bubbling, splashing, hustle.
The water rippled, rocking the lily pads, the water beetles hurriedly scurried in all directions, and finally a pulsating golden glow appeared in the mysterious depths.
It was impossible to figure out what it was until the father dragged a heavy crucian onto the trampled grass.
He was lying on his side, catching his breath, and fluttering his fins.
His scales gave off an amazing scent of the underwater kingdom.
Yasha was counting the seconds to himself.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzevsky Lane to the Landesman Sanatorium.
In the sanatorium behind the high fence and iron gates, we always felt completely safe.
Especially if you didn't light up the smokehouses.
As we were passing by the gateway, Yasha tripped.
Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzovsky lane, Yasha claimed that every time you want to do something in the best possible way, you are bound to stumble over a trifle.
I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything.
But I kept silent so as not to upset Yasha.
We stealthily went down the alley.
I said that we need to go on the side where the archway is, stop just before reaching it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently dart past the archway.
The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically precise.
If there are people in the alley, they might not notice us.
However, if we go on the opposite side from the alleyway, we might be spotted from a distance.
I calculated that in the last case we would be moving against a dangerous blind alley, or rather, we would be in sight of people hiding in the alley five times longer.
And, therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed.
In the morning, I was awakened by the hot sun hitting the white walls.
Red and yellow hollyhocks swayed behind the open window.
Together with them, a nasturtium flower peeked into the room; a furry bee sat inside it.
I watched, frozen, as she angrily retreated and extracted herself from the tight flower.
Endless bright streaks ran across the ceiling, light waves reflecting off the river.
The river roared right here, nearby.
