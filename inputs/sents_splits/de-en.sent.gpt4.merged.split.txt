"Shut up," said the optician louder and paced faster, "Selma rarely finds anything threatening or unattractive."
He was completely right about that, and unfortunately, he said more than he should have responded to the voices.
But love might indeed find her unattractive, the voices whispered, there was a reason, they said, why the truth was hidden for so long.
"That was cowardice," said the optician, shifting the leather bag to his other hip because the jostling of the bag and the jostling of voices were slowly beginning to hurt.
"That was prudence," said the voices, "Fear is sometimes a good advisor," they said and hummed the title melody of the early evening series.
The optician is now slowing down.
The journey to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly felt like a day's travel, a day's travel with very, very much luggage.
That was true.
The dog was the color of slushy snow, it was a faded gray and shaggy like a purebred Irish Wolfhound with nothing else mixed in.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear paws, and we all knew what that meant.
Selma still stood upright in front of the kitchen bench.
She looked at the dog for a long time.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift idea store.
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as Farmer Häubel himself had been his entire life.
He was certain that death would not snatch life away from him, but would gently take it from his hand.
He imagined Death knocking gently, only opening the door a crack and asking, "May I?", to which Farmer Häubel would naturally agree.
"Of course," Farmer Häubel would say, "please come in," and Death would enter.
He would stand by Farmer Häubel's bed and ask: "Is it convenient for you now?"
I can also come by at a later time.
Farmer Häubel would sit up and say, "No, no, it suits me just fine", "let us not postpone it again, who knows when you can arrange it again", and Death would take a seat on the already prepared chair at the head of the table.
He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which, as Farmer Häubel knew, would not bother him at all, and then place a hand on Farmer Häubel's eyes.
The people in the village were uneasy, you could see it on them, even though they mostly tried not to show it.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, people in the village were moving as if black ice had formed on all paths, not only outside but also inside the houses, black ice in the kitchens and living rooms.
They moved as if their own bodies were completely alien to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable.
They distrusted their own life the whole day long and, as far as possible, everyone else's.
Again and again they looked behind them, checking to see if anyone was coming at them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing significant left to lose, and they quickly looked forward again because someone without a mind could also attack from the front.
They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles, branches or heavy lampshades.
They avoided all animals, because they believed it could break out faster from them than from humans.
They circumvented the benign cows, which might lash out today, they avoided the dogs, even the very old ones that could barely stand, but might still go for their throats today.
On days like these, everything was possible, where even decrepit dachshunds could bite through your throat, it wasn't much more absurd than an okapi after all.
Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were mostly not superstitious.
They carelessly did everything that one must not do with superstitions:
They sat calmly under wall clocks, even though in superstition one can die from it, they slept with their heads towards the door, even though in superstition it means that one will soon be carried out through that very door feet first.
They hung laundry between Christmas and New Year's, which, as Elsbeth warned, in superstition equates to suicide or aiding and abetting murder.
They were not frightened when the screech owl called at night, when a horse in the stable broke out in heavy sweat, when a dog howled at night with its head lowered.
The train ride took fifteen minutes, there were no stops.
Since our first train ride, we always played the same thing:
We positioned ourselves with our backs to the windows at the opposite train doors, Martin closed his eyes, I looked out of the train door window, which was behind Martin.
In the first grade, I told Martin what I saw during the trip, and Martin tried to memorize everything.
That worked out really well, so that by the second year of school I no longer had to list anything and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could recite almost everything I was seeing through the fogged up train window: "Wire factory," he said, just as we were passing the wire factory.

"What else could it have been," said Selma, "it's hard to confuse an okapi with any other animal."
"But," I said, "it could have just been a malformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a freak of nature.
And the stripes and the rust-red color, one cannot identify all that accurately in the night; after all, everything is quite blurry."
"That is just nonsense," Selma said, rubbing her forehead, "that is unfortunately just nonsense, Luise."
She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it over and put it in my lunchbox.
Do you know exactly when you dreamed that?
"Around three o'clock," Selma said.
She had jolted upright, after the image of the okapi had retreated, sitting up in bed she had awoken and stared at her nightgown, in which she had just stood on the Uhlheck in her dream, and then at the alarm clock.
Three o'clock.
"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously," Selma said, but she said it like a television detective who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously.
"What's the matter?" I asked.
"Nothing," Selma cooed, opening the fridge, taking out a pack of sliced cheese and a liver sausage, and waving them through the air.
"What would you like on your sandwich for school today?", she trilled.
"Little mouse," she cooed after him, and the cooing and the term "little mouse" were indeed alarming.
"Cheese, please," I said, "what do you have?"
"Nothing," sang Selma, "I told you so."
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and because she was still flailing about, she knocked the cheese off the counter with her wrist.
Selma now stood still and looked down at the cheese package, as if it were something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
Selma had dreamed of an Okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, so we were convinced that a dream about an Okapi and death were definitely linked.
Our mind works like this.
He can ensure in the shortest possible time that the most disparate things belong tightly together.
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and Christmas trees.
When I slept downstairs at Selma's, she would tell me bedtime stories with happy endings.
When I was younger, after the stories, I always grasped her wrist, put my thumb on her pulse and imagined that the whole world did everything to the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat.
I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting a weight, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the retailer stocking juice boxes, my mother stacking spruce branches, my father stamping prescriptions, and all doing so in sync with Selma's heartbeat.
I always reliably fell asleep to that, but now, at the age of ten, Selma thought I was too old for it.
