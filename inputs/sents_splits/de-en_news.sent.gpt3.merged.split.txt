Diego Cocca will be the new national coach of Mexico.
In summer 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the United States and Canada, featuring 48 teams for the first time.
Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar.
The 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the position until a few days ago.
He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November.
His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting.
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) are putting up the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blooms" also includes information about what is currently blooming there in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht.
"Geesthacht is blossoming" is the name of an initiative by Nabu in cooperation with the municipal administration.
With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, companies, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015.
Goal: In the Geesthacht area, extensive flower islands should be created where insects can find food at any time.
"In favorable weather conditions, bees start flying out in January to search for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthachter Nabu.
He has beehives on the property himself.
So that the endeavor doesn't remain just an action of nature conservationists and the Environmental Department of the city, but reaches far into private gardens, explanatory signs about the plants are repeatedly placed.
About 50 signs so far.
Passersby should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is currently blooming so beautifully here.
The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant at home selectively.
Season start was already in the first week of January at the wild hazel.
Of more recent date, shrubs such as winter honeysuckle and winter viburnum are found in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
They have been stuck in the ground of the planters on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, just now showing their first delicate white and pink blooms, and have recently been adorned with more signs.
The winter-scented honeysuckle is a very wide-spreading shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide, as stated there along with further information about the suitable location.
Season start was already in the first week of January at the wild hazel.

Ringe emphasizes that not only the bedding plants are now showing flowers.
She blooms particularly lushly on Richtweg near the incline, on Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg, and many ditches.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Dancing keeps me young."
Munich dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her when he looks down from heaven to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday at exactly 3 p.m., three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" for a lively tap dance.
Together, they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
Birthday.
For the native Munich resident (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is the highlight of the week.
"Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine myself without them."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing their dancing legs.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926.
She was a soubrette, today one would say musical performer, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk.
I have spent my life with dancing, acting, and singing.
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the young one in the group of tap dancers.
She says, "We simply have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: The tap dance was developed in the 19th century.
Century was developed in the USA and is known all over the world today.
With two metal plates attached to the front and back of the shoes, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that match the visual impression and music.
The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician.
The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French is Claquettes.
The Spanish flamenco could have influenced tap dancing.
The shoe tips are nailed so they produce a loud audible sound while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof.
She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer.
"We are a large family, where big and small, old and young are welcome."
And what is the recipe for such a long life?
"The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD.
Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in dialogue The limits of the digital.
With progressing digitalization, the desire for analog is growing again among some.
The rapid pace at which our everyday life became digital left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapt our methods of communication and work, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden.
If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options.
Either one belonged to the six percent of lucky ones who had a private connection.
Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call with the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger.
Or one could look for a telephone booth.
Unforgettable the smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of small coins in the vending machine.
My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when making a phone call.
Video calling, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What now in Moldova?
14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so.
So far, Recean was one of the advisors to the president.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned.
The pro-European Prime Minister was under massive pressure, as she herself stated as an explanation for her resignation, apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war.
The inflation rate is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, as it holds 63 out of 101 seats.
The confirmation of the new prime minister and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, in recent months, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity while pro-Russian ones with support from the Kremlin have become more popular.

Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint.
Bö continued his impressive streak despite challenging conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season.
The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen.
The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 world championship gold medals.
Even partially strong fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig.
On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already succeeded in defending their title.
Hardly anyone doubts that there will be a sequel to hunting race number three.
In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite.
His running form is outstanding, allowing him to effortlessly compensate for shooting errors up to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll again.
After the veteran had given up all chances of a medal in the opening mixed relay with a penalty loop and finished only in sixth place, three days later things didn't improve.
Three penalty loops already in the prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago in Hochfilzen, he won unexpectedly with a wafer-thin lead of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö.
It was one of only three career successes Doll had, having stood on the podium once this winter.
The eighth-place finisher from Beijing silently left after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews.
Roman Rees finished in 19th place, the second WM debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives
Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the focus is primarily on the value of democracy.
Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been tested," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington.
"We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength."
Lula replied, referring to his right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff at the end of October.
On January 1st, Lula took office.
The change of power was accompanied by violent riots.
Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government seat in the capital Brasília in January.
The outbreak of violence in Brazil ominously reminds us of the storming of the US Capitol over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden.
His predecessor did not care much about international relationships.
"His world started and ended with fake news, in the morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula.
"Sounds familiar to me," Biden remarked, an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the newspaper der Freitag.
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters?
One could see the members of the Red Army Faction who were denounced and allowed to be shot.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous enemies of the FRG; let's say the bourgeois democracy, let's say the late capitalist society.
(Here nothing about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more interested in Raudis on the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is releasing a new edition featuring Putin's "war criminal" friends.
Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery.
Of course, the StZ is poorly informed because in this world including Asia, Africa, and Latin America there are perhaps more "friends of Russia" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, rather:
In positions 1 to 5 (!) is Mrs. Wagenknecht, then followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my surroundings anymore who reads this newspaper.
If only, it would be high time now.
We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing below it anymore.
(And now no differentiation is necessary.)

Glööckler files for divorce from his husband
Dieter Schroth Designer
Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated.
This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording.
There it says: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for the dissolution of his registered partnership through his family lawyer at the relevant court.
"I will not comment on the details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there have been rumors of a separation for about a year.
According to various media reports, after his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in Pfalz to Berlin.
He also talked about marital problems on the RTL show.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian
Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflation to be "absolutely" necessary.
The inflationary risks remain significant.
"The costs for energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also temporarily boost prices," Sewing said in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and indicated another increase by 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16th.
The interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent.
The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates increase the cost of loans.
This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates.
Higher interest rates can lead to the postponement of investments and thus weaken economic growth.
Rising interest rates are a burden for heavily indebted eurozone countries such as Italy.
"The consequences of a persistently high inflation are significantly more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing.
"Of course, we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at an inflation rate of two percent.
This target has been far away for months.
In January, the upward pressure on prices weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can buy less for one euro.
Significantly increased energy prices, which drive inflation significantly, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB).
I currently see the biggest danger for the German economy in that.
But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.
Bosch CEO
Stefan
Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Speed" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD).
There will need to be a political and social dialogue about it.
"And it will maybe also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart.
He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge, with which it may not necessarily have to go as quickly as with the LNG terminals that were put into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened.
The goal was to partially close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke on the occasion of a new "Germany speed".
In addition, the Federal Government recently initiated an acceleration of the approval process for wind turbines and power lines.
First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters.
"This should not automatically mean, however, that from now on we will always act categorically and for example, install a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung.
Therefore, there must still be a negotiation process about what society considers right and wrong.
In the past, they tried it with the classic set of rules and didn't succeed.
We should reconsider whether the previous approach was correct.
Maybe we have exaggerated with the regulations and made it too complicated for ourselves.
In view of the many pending tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, Hartung said he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved.
As a consumer of these energies, I definitely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.
Union warns against dismantling the Bayer Group.
The Chemistry Union IG BCE warns of a dismantling of the company after an announced change in leadership at Bayer.
"From the employees' point of view, Bayer is well positioned with its three main pillars for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the trade union and member of Bayer's supervisory board, to the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
"This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medications, and the agricultural business."
You can only cope with the transformation of industry through a corporate policy that is based on risk diversification and sustainability, not hedge fund activism.
The background is the announced change of leadership at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company on Thursday.
The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will leave his position this summer.
Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, is set to take over in early June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time.
The manager is burdened by the 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed company Monsanto for 63 billion dollars.
With the purchase, the Leverkusen company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate into their own house.
The Bayer stock has been in a downward trend for years.
In 2019, the shareholders denied the CEO discharge at the general meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann does not seek an extension of his contract, which should actually run until 2024.
Pressure had been exerted by long-term oriented strategic investors.
Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors like Bluebell Capital also got involved.
According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the company.
The very small fund with an unknown level of participation in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach.
A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post".
He, on the other hand, does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to protest against pension reform.
Paris
On Saturday, the French plan to take to the streets again in protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's project with a strong protest on the streets.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against the pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate nationwide on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform.
For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the centrist government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years old.
Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes.
Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at the protests.
A turbulent debate in parliament has been ongoing for a week over the controversial reform.
Already now, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62 if they have not paid enough for a pension without deductions by reaching the retirement age.
In many demanding occupations, the opponents of the reform believe that people could hardly work longer.
In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not wear out their health completely in the job.
Macron: Impending deficit in the pension fund.
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund.
Because the population is getting older, the employees should bear the burden of an increasing number of retirees with their contributions.
In order to maintain the level of the pension, the population must work a little more.
The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find alternative sources of funding to sustain the pension system.
But the government doesn't just want to tinker with the retirement age.
The already decided increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension is to be accelerated.
In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished.
The minimum pension is set to increase to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects.
During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, there were already massive protests and strikes at that time.
Several presidents before Macron made efforts with varying success to reform the French pension system, widespread protest and strikes were certain for all of them.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support.
Some of the deputies from Macron's faction still have reservations.
And even greater than the fear of a close vote, the concern about paralyzing strikes is likely to be at Macron's forefront at the moment.
Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could rely on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected in high altitudes with a lot of sunshine.
A powerful high-pressure system is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany.
Does this mean that there will be a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach Offenbach
In Germany, calm high pressure weather is expected at least until midweek.
This high pressure system will shift slightly eastward over the course of the next week.
However, it still determines the weather in Germany.
However, quiet high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel.
Such a high can even be quite mean and provide people in the lowlands with days of dreary high fog gray, while there is pure sunshine in the higher elevations of the low mountain ranges.
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions.
According to the DWD, it may continue to rain a bit from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest all the way to Lower Bavaria.
Especially along the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and parts of the west, the cloud cover will clear up during the day and the sun will appear more frequently.
In the rest of the country, it remains mostly cloudy or covered with high fog.
The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble away at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist.
At the edge of the Alps, in the high-altitude regions of the low mountain ranges, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, full-day sunshine is expected, elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high cloud cover.
The maximum temperatures range from 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees in the Lower Rhine region, while only around 3 degrees are expected in the persistent grayness in the southeast.
A weak wind is blowing from various directions.
On Tuesday, there may be persistent fog or mist in some low-lying areas.
Otherwise, the weather appears clear after the fog clears.
According to forecasts, the sun is expected to shine all day in high-altitude areas, large parts of NRW, and along the edge of the Alps.
The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin is struggling: Still no World Cup medal for Goggia.
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia showed herself deeply disappointed after her elimination in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not deliver the performance that I am capable of," said the Italian woman on ZDF after she fouled one goal and was eliminated.
After all, the 30-year-old was able to prevent a possibly severe fall just in time.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years.
She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far.
After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing.
However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to continue waiting for a World Championship medal in her favorite discipline.
During her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was absent due to injury.
Méribel
I actually thought I was in a good mood.
I am disappointed.
I gave it everything.
But that's life.
Sometimes one believes things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that was expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."

Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10th.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station.
The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin.
With the release of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for assistance in the search for a missing child.
The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children towards Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 p.m.
On February 10, 2023.
She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station.
The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has only very limited knowledge of the German language and the area.

Selenskyj and Ministers against Russia's Olympic participation.
Paris Kiev.
It was agreed during a joint telephone conference to prepare a statement in order to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back from international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport reported on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain.
The British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it was a very productive meeting.
And I made Britain's position very clear:
As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games.
"We will now make a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials.
"While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Selenskyj.
He published his speech on his Telegram channel.
Because of the Russian aggression war, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott.
Ukraine also sees
Belarus as a warring party because the country provides military bases to Russian troops for attacks.
Selensky called on officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the participation of Russian athletes in the competitions.
The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The occasion for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that they wanted to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions.
Ukraine threatens with a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position Paris
There is no reason from our perspective to invite Russian and Belarusian sports teams to return to the competitions.
Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unrestricted solidarity and support of the international sports community.
The spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior stated in response to a dpa inquiry: "The IOC's efforts to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way."
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "The sports world should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population."
Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum.
On the other hand, Russia emphasizes that sport and politics must be separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions.
However, the IOC aims for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.

Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's tank inventory greatly reduced Half of the vehicles lost?
USA see Moscow's tank inventory significantly depleted.
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a considerable number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war.
The speech is about "half of the main inventory."
The Russian army has already lost half of its combat tanks in its offensive war against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense.
"Approximately half of the main inventory of tanks" in the Russian Army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information about the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates at an online event held by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is set to receive multiple combat tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks.
Britain has pledged to deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks to Kiev in March.
Germany plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other countries by April.
The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks.
However, your delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia wants to step up.
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev hinted at the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks.
"As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, rockets, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk.
"It is clear that it is self-evident for us in this case to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that enables a stronger orientation of the economy towards the needs of the military.
This can, for example, oblige individual industries to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army personnel appointment.
Because the position that will be filled by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM), Christian Ortner, in the future was not advertised.
The staff representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption in the appointment and abuse of office.
Minister of Defense Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously vacant position, according to the Minister.
She does not want to comment on the "speculations of a libertarian employee representative".
Ortner was replaced at the helm of the HGM last year after 17 years.
In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying.
These have been cleared from Tanner's perspective.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortners' suitability in terms of content.
He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues in security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner regarding the "unusual ordering process".
The decision is associated with the "appearance of political favoritism," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer.
The Neos demand that Tanner withdraw her appointment.
The ÖVP is "still neck-deep in the swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for defense.
He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools buckle under the costs.
Thuringia's carnival stronghold
Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional Fasching parade, unlike the state capital.
However, the higher costs, including security, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling.
The funds alone for this accounted for approximately half of the estimated total costs for the relocation.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg.
The "Train of Merry People" in Cottbus, possibly once again the largest in East Germany, takes place for the first time after the pandemic.
Even during the Swabian-Alemannic Carnival, no parades were cancelled.
Despite the increased costs, Marne, the carnival stronghold of Schleswig-Holstein, is holding onto the traditional parade.
"We are carrying out our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen.
But here too the financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors are not found or if the existing ones contribute more, reserves would have to be tapped into "that cannot be done every year".
The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation:
There is a partial price increase of up to 60 percent for sweets, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Support Association.
Due to lucky misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough supply this time.
For the move, it is already clear that it will be more expensive.
Double the amount of staff as in 2020 will be needed for security.
Those who stand at the side of the road at the Rosenmontag parade in the Rhineland may receive fewer candies than before.
Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have as much with them.
Candy or not, the visitor turnout is expected to be large: "I believe that if it doesn't rain buckets on that day, then we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne parade leader.
"This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years."
"The train is of course irreplaceable."
The Cologne Festival Committee does not comment in detail on costs.
The train is generally "deficitary", that's no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Moonshine Vodka
Ukrainians are rightly known for their tolerance to alcohol.
There is domestic beer like Obolon from Kyiv or beer from Lviv.
Every now and then I discover German beer here.
Not a Kulmbacher, but other big breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner.
I can't taste a big difference there.
The same applies to vodka, which is widely spread.
They primarily burn them here in the villages themselves.
They call him Samargon.
No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics.
In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had decreased by an astonishing 80 percent in five years.
Well, you can see here too how little one can trust the Russians.
It is said that as a tourist, one should be careful with it.
But that applies only if it goes into mass production.
There will probably be adulteration.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Eating and drinking
Whoever wants to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or a night out in der Stadt, der ist bei uns genau richtig.
If you want to drink beer after work, you will find great places for that in Rostock and Warnemünde.
The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-gaming for club parties.

Biathlon World Championships: Federal
President expects favorite to win and praises Oberhof.
Federal President
Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife
Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger's arena by the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof.
The German biathletes were not involved in the medal allocation at the Oberhof World Championship sprint.
But there were two glimmers of hope in the mist.
However much the Federal President strained himself, it was not possible to see from the grandstand on Saturday whether the targets on the shooting range were actually falling.
"I had to get the results on my phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, pointing out the foggy clouds that frequently settle in the stadium and significantly affect the visibility at Rennsteig for spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he disclosed, also praising Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and provides ideal conditions."
This is also confirmed by the athletes with thanks to those who have been involved since the allocation of the World Cup here.
Even in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and therefore "secure for the next years and even decades".
Oberhof.
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö left his competitors behind in a sporty manner.
Behind him, his flawlessly shooting brother
Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind), Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds behind) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
1.
The local cross-country skiers were unable to compete for medals the day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph.
Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes.
WM debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6).
Two glimmers of light behind the gray veil.
On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed once again.
After his failed mixed event on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs this time and finished as 55th.
Bö started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and confirmed this status despite the difficult visibility conditions.
However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the skillful; they landed on the edge of the targets and still fell.
The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion.
"We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday.
In the case of women, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick.
"If you start as number one, the goal is not to come in tenth."
"There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one position," said sports director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" under obligation.
The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 hours/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "bee swarm" on the pitch.
Referee
Felix Brych decides on a drop ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches?
Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike conduct.
Referee chief
Fröhlich emphasizes the role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field.
"I do think that there are new behaviors from the players, where they swarm around the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him towards the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency.
"We discussed this during the winter break."
We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior.
We will pay closer attention to that again and will also impose sanctions.
Recently, two coaches were also awarded with red cards.
Mainz coach Bo Svensson saw the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern.
For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund resulted in a yellow-red card.
Also, the behavior of the coach falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct.
We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive.
"We will consistently penalize such unsporting behavior," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael
Fröhlich pointed out a generally good cooperation between coaches and officials.
Overall, the proportion fits.
There are reactions, which are followed by consistent counter-reactions.
The person affected will have to live with that.
"That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
Conflicts can indeed arise from emotional intensity during the course of the game.
But when the emotionality spills over into personal slander, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich.
In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared up matters afterwards.
"It would be important if a process of rethinking as a whole were to be set in motion, so that such behavior just isn't acceptable," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at another level.
"Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact."
There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation.
"In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviors," said Fröhlich.
"Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation with an exchange of perspectives between referees and those involved is always helpful."
Combiner
Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometer cross-country skiing race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter.
Third place was taken by Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combination team does not compete in the Black Forest with their best lineup.
Peking Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not there.
They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from the 21st.
February to March 5th will take place in Planica, Slovenia.
"We have three world-class athletes at home.
"The team naturally feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5.
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children.
According to a police announcement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit the back of a car during a slight traffic jam and pushed it into two other cars.
The full closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum Have launched the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) are standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, 12th.
In February, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Sculpture Museum.
There are some extras for the final.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3pm in the interim quarters of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum on Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
In three exhibition rooms, two large-scale murals draw attention to themselves.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear.
However, a catalog documents the artworks specifically created for the Marler Museum.
He will be introduced by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag on February 12th.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in service of the community at the closing event.
Using numerous examples, she introduces the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who obtained her doctorate in 2013 on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic.
Since then, she has been researching art related to architecture as well as the art and institutional history of post-war Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in public buildings in North Rhine-Westphalia.
After the lecture, the final curator guided tour of the exhibition takes place.
The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It's about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings.
In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul.
In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued due to potential construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake.
In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors.
The accused are supposed to be responsible for construction defects that would have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu.
As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said.
According to the information, one of the suspects was arrested at Istanbul airport.
He is said to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported.
According to reports, nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake of magnitude 7.6 at noon.
More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former prime minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has passed away.
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag.
The 95-year-old died during the night from Friday to Saturday.
Fraction leader
Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," announced the Left Party faction in the Bundestag on Saturday.
The party is losing "an important personality," said the parliamentary leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former parliamentary leader Gregor Gysi.
Dresden.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st.
As prime minister, he was involved in the end of the GDR.
Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR for about 150 days.
In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow, a month later, lost his office.
The last prime minister of the GDR until reunification was the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The faction leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist."
Bartsch added: Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed.
The entire peaceful process of the establishment of German unity was just a special achievement of his.
"That will be his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
Furthermore, it says: His later work in the People's Chamber, Bundestag, European Parliament, and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population which was unwanted and whose interests were regularly violated.
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 for the PDS and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically".
The German reunification was said to have happened too quickly, the GDR is said to have perished unconditionally, and it was criticized by Modrow in many interviews for being condemned as an "unjust state", according to dpa.
What happened in the night Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks.
Meanwhile, Kyiv must carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kiev
The recent wave of Russian missile attacks once again forces emergency repairs on the Ukrainian energy grid.
But Ukraine also attacks Russian positions.
Several thermal and hydro power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy provider Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television.
The power supply in the area of Kharkiv is particularly poor.
Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, while production was reduced at the Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
Paris
President
Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with around 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism.
Selenskyj will not abandon the small town of Bachmut.
On February 24th, there will have been a war for one year.
US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary.
The risk of Russian missile attacks continued into Saturday night.
In the capital of Kiev, air raid alarm was triggered for the fifth time on late Friday evening.
"A drone attack is imminent," announced the military administration of the Kiev region.
Combat drones of Iranian design were also sighted and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
German Railways: Federal government selects consultant for network company.
Demands, including those of the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign, to split these failed due to the coalition partner SPD.
In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on the establishment of an infrastructure company, which should be oriented towards the public welfare in the future.
That means she doesn't need to generate and pay profits.
Backlog of renovations totaling 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the federal government accompany this process.
The backlog of repairs in the railway network is a major reason why the train is currently running very unpunctually.
Transport Minister
Wissing has made it his task to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors.
The investments necessary for this have been estimated at 50 billion euros so far.
According to more recent calculations by the railway, they are estimated to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023
Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick:
"Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances did not apparently speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick.
She said she had slept poorly after the race, she had been "totally excited", her heart rate didn't calm down even during warm-up.
"Such a race", and that at the home World Cup, "you cannot describe it with words," she said.
11,000 spectators cheered to booming Schlager music with German flags, coaches and team members embraced each other.
"Enjoy biathlon," she had planned For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high.
The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the largest, if not the only, German hope for medals outside of the relays.
Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter, the only German to do so.
In the overall World Cup, she currently holds fifth place.
And even though the power density at the top level is clearly higher among women than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, one had different contenders in mind for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state.
He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom.
The relationship between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church has been heavily strained since 2018.
At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation had sought refuge in churches.
More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018.
Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests.
President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special funds
First armament projects have already been canceled, the same fate threatens other plans, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag".
However, it is currently not possible to say which specific investments would be eliminated.
"There is no need, at the current time, to assign specific procurement measures to a potential need for savings," said a response from the federal government to a query from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the declining investment amount is the rising interest rates.
The fully credit-financed special asset, which the Bundestag decided in June 2022, must bear the interest costs for the loans itself.
If these rise, less money is available for specific purchases for the Bundeswehr.
In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining amount decreases.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured persons.
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.) around 01.40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell direction, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway entrance towards Heilbronn onto the motorway.
At this time, a 21-year-old female VW driver was traveling on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as reported by the police.
During the turning maneuver of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them.
An inspection of the traffic light system found no objections.
Further investigations will follow.
The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured in the accident.
They had to be admitted to a hospital.
There was a total property damage of approximately 20,000 euros to the two cars.
Schlossplatz
Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many residents of Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria.
The sympathy is great also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria preoccupies the world.
On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members had responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men.
They all listened to the imam's prayer request seriously and silently.
In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster.
He requested, among other things, health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with one another.
The community also requested assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and in Syria.
The speakers expressed their sympathy for the affected individuals and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event.
The supplications were also translated into German on the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great.
Several million euros have already been raised in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected material donations on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported to the earthquake-stricken areas by truck.
The willingness to help there was overwhelming.
Hike with meat inclusion Ebersberg.
After eating you should rest or take a thousand steps....
The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice.
In the years of the pandemic, the good old digestion walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance.
Because those who, thanks to home office, are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air.
At least one could get this impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 pm not only dog owners gather.
One reason could of course also be that modern humans, in the course of optimal time slot utilization, can combine health-promoting fresh air supply with other things.
Because why not find out news from the settlement on the occasion of a short hike through nature with the long unseen neighbor?
Or meet up with the friend you never manage to go to the cinema with in the evenings, not even to the old cinema?
In this way, it's also possible to combine work and private life.
Who says that appointments with tax advisors, lawyers, or financial advisors cannot take place outdoors?
If there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural products.
Fresh fruit, for example, that is placed together with a little box of cheese on a table by the roadside.
Or potatoes and meat.
Stupid only if one doesn't think about the purchase in advance and make the necessary preparations.
An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden salesroom of the farmer with empty hands and a tone of regret in their voices.
Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money.
The disappointment can be empathized with, as one does have a companion with a wallet, but not a means of transportation.
What one lets the friendly chance encounter know.
To which the man responds: "But that's not true!
You do have a bag with you!"
He points to the hood of the jacket that one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary.
"My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat filling and, during this short midday excursion, not only becomes richer by a lamb's back but also by an extremely practical idea.
It is quite possible that a second walk will be necessary on this day after dinner.
This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured.
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for unknown reasons, left the road to the right in a left curve, according to the police report.
In doing so, the Audi damaged a delineator post, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop several meters away.
The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision.
The fire department freed him with heavy equipment.
The emergency medical service took the seriously injured person to a hospital.
Since there was suspicion of being unfit to drive, the collection of a blood sample was ordered.
According to the police report, there was total damage to the Audi amounting to 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records:
Point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided:
The tax authority must hand over the former president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, back then still in office as the President of the USA.
The Finance Ministry must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the decision of the Ministry on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump did not publicly disclose his tax returns neither as a candidate nor later as president.
He fought until the Supreme Court against a release.
A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public unless a trial occurred.
The handover to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump.
There the circle of authorized persons is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the course of the committee's investigation.
In addition, confidential information from the parliament repeatedly becomes public.
The Chairwoman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law."
Access to the tax documents of the Republican is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter.
"The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi stated.

British serial criminal caught in Thailand after long escape.
After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been captured in Thailand.
As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) reported on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok.
The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals sought by the NCA.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled before the beginning of a court trial at the beginning of 2018.
He had been sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table.
Bielefeld
What is being served remains a secret beforehand.
Because people should primarily come to the Vesperkirche to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu.
This Sunday it starts, then the Neustadt Marienkirche will be turned into a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret stories from the Big Apple Vince Ebert has a mission:
The trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and claims to love Viennese humor, advocates for science in his cabaret programs.
The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" is fitting for this.
Whether this is a good fit in the generally prevailing domestic skepticism towards science remains to be seen.
His sense of humor, in any case, fits very well in Vienna.
The English title, by the way, is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to make a name for himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019.
But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what science actually is and what it can do, and above all, what it cannot.
Of course, Corona is also mentioned, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many push ahead of them:
What is really important?
All of this with a huge wink, relaxed and very ironic.
And so not only will you be well entertained, but you can also learn something in the process.
Please go to the typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many lives.
My phone is ringing with an unknown number.
I assume.
This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.

#DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes are traveling together (!) to Germany for the first time.
I'm excited to see who I'll meet there and who I'll get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she too is a CDU minister.
So this is really nothing new, it's the same with every electronic ticket.
Check-in/check-out is a completely different story.
Certainly no reason to do something about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Is anyone playing #wortify and found the word with all the letters today?
If so, please let me know, it's driving me crazy.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device
BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor.
This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver.
The battles are fought in a wide valley, completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes.
In the valley plain there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that provide temporary protection to the player, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile rockets that become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay.
Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals.
These cannot attack the player tank.
On the other hand, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO hit.
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating modes.
These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the gameplay sequence, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test sequence.
The latter mode represents a special sequence for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay Gameplay
The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible.
If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is ended.
The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen.
The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left corner of his cockpit.
In addition, a point representing the enemy position is visible on the extensive radar screen accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, conical surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the underlying screen.
If the opponent is in this area, they can be easily targeted on the screen.
Furthermore, the opponent in the firing range is simultaneously displayed in the upper left information display.
1. Gameplay
Temporary UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield.
These are harmless projectiles that observe the combat situation and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank.
The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar.
The UFOs are intended to round off the combat situation and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or rockets.
UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank.
A shot by the player earns them 5,000 points.
If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached:
A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player tank or a slowly moving enemy tank.
Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be unlocked and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult gameplay.
Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input for highest results Gameplay
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the highest scores table, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game ends.
The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages.
Please note that by triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone analog vector generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply, the high score table will be cleared.
When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores will be saved with their initials and written back on the screen to challenge other players.
Any score that is over 100,000 will be additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials.
If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write dashes.
CONSTRUCTION ARRANGEMENT
1.
New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components.
If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should take note of these important differences.
The new parts are: A.
The control lever.
This is a reconstruction of the ATARI gear lever.
It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts.
Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever back to the neutral position.
The micro switches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement.
B. Two PC boards.
ATARI's X/Y game circuitry has been extended onto two (2) interconnected boards.
These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board.
With the help of this circuit technology, more lines are produced on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and stable image.
C. The power supply.
Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply.
It has a larger, more powerful transformer to support the increased power supply provided by the circuit expansion.
D.
The device housing.
Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity.
Furthermore, the device contains a console that is intended as a platform for smaller players to make playing easier.
At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1.
If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol.
2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play.
Nevertheless, you should carry out a certain verification to round off the quality control.
To ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out:
NOTE:
Do not connect device to the 220 V power supply yet.
A. Inspect the exterior of the housing for any damage.
Open the maintenance panel of the device and check the components inside the device as follows:
(1) Check all cable harness connectors for proper and secure connection.
Potential open or NOTE: Never force plug connections.
The plugs are equipped with a guiding system, so that a correct connection is established.
A plug connection turned 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2)
Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and secure seating.
(3) Please note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device.
Check whether the punched production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, Control/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor.
An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual.
This number should always be provided when calling your specialist dealer for further service information.
(4)
Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console, and TV monitor for proper assembly.
(5)
Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and turned on.
With a glance through the viewing glass of the player, it should be checked whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the casing.
If the opening is not precisely centered, the cover attached to the housing with adhesive tape must be released and realigned.
Before connecting the device to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage.
Check the cable color at the plug and verify the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING ISSUES WITH YOUR SOFTWARE?
Below you will find a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games.
Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package.
With the help of the DirectX diagnostic tool, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements.
Please proceed as follows to access the DirectX diagnostic program:
Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option.
Enter "dxdiag" into the text field.
Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed.
Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card.
You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound.
Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program.
Before starting the game
It is possible that other programs may take up the system resources that the game needs to run smoothly.
Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many are started automatically when the system boots up.
Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called "background applications".
In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing.
Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before starting the game.
If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or deactivate them before starting the game.
Look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar.
Right-click the icon and select the corresponding option ("Disable," "Close," or similar).
Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close any general background applications as these can sometimes cause issues when installing or running a PC game.
You can read more about it in the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications".
Clean up the system.
Before you install software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally.
Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals.
The tools you need for this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly.
Then the chances are high that current games will run largely problem-free on your PC.
A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use otherwise run faster and more stably.
Consult the Windows help files to learn about the tools ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation, and disk cleanup.
The use of Windows Help.
1.
Click the "Start" button and choose the option "Help" (or "Help and Support") to access the Windows Help.
2.
Now click on the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation", and "Disk Cleanup".
You will then receive instructions explaining how to use these tools.
Does the game crash or freeze?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.
This can often prevent a game from crashing or freezing.
First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card.
Below you will find the most current graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression through which one could push the world to its limits.
She represented an opportunity for me to explore new horizons.
I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century.
Century before:
On the one hand, I struggled with the still undeveloped technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered, especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual.
To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger.
I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny fraction of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and neglected a fundamental element of the human experience: emotions.
Meanwhile, the technology was making rapid progress.
Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations.
Although this could naturally have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here.
Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting disgusting monsters in dark corridors and shooting crates to get ammunition, but also has much more demanding and profound content.
It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements.
I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will have fun with this new gaming experience.
If you are rather skeptical about playing video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will contribute to changing your attitude in this regard.
May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition.
The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything for the first time.
Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were repeatedly forced to question many previously considered inviolable principles.
I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit, like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you, also doesn't pass by without a trace for you.

If a setting is desired that is not the default setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch.
After a single press, the upper setting value is set to 0, which means that personal adjustment is possible.
Since the lower values remain unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable.
Once the setting has been made, any newly adjustable size can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch.
If unintentionally pressed, the default setting appears.
The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switches.
Pressing the "Test" button will end the process.
The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot.
Coin units "credit" indicates the number of units required before a credit is issued.
"Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued.
"Min.-coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a defined minimum amount of coins is reached.
This value is not used in the default setting "0".
CMOS MEMORY (storage)
FAILURE
When "Memory Failure Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, where all programming is stored, has failed.
All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings.
This condition probably indicates a battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method.
Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display).
All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin.
The tests and settings can be entered into the respective program display, pressing the "Test" switch will show the next program each time.
If a long-term test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto-test mode.
In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is shut down.
When the message "Open coin door to test" appears, the programming plug J 19, 1 2 must be inserted.
With the unplugged plug J 19, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed.
Hardware tests:
These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of every video ROM and compares it with the stored checksum for this ROM.
If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs.
If the checksum of ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first.
If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced.
The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a bank (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs.
The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732).
Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking if the storage was correct.
LED value: 00 0010
If the Gerdt with the above.
Display holds, an error was detected.
If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board.
To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test.
A failure means: errors in the U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM.
If the test was passed, all memory locations will be set to their previous value.
LED value: 00 0011
If the device with the above-mentioned display stops working, there is an error.
Check in this case U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits.
Test video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM.
These numbers will be checked for accuracy when read back.
LED value: 00 0100
When this value is displayed, an error has occurred.
Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM).
The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page.
The results of these registrations will be compared to the original pattern.
Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM.
If a display RAM fails, diagnose the issue and replace the RAM.
If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it will display that the next test is starting (Data Hardware).
The connection to the data processor must be available and it must be functioning.
Unfortunately disappointed 1.
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics.
The 2nd one to arrive without any visible seam flaws is the right jacket.
BUT I was really looking forward to this jacket, so the disappointment was even greater.
I ordered the jacket in size L based on the other reviews.
Because it should be so tight and I didn't want to struggle into an S or M with my bust size....
In the end, it would have fit length-wise and at the hips...in the rest I could swim.
In addition, the feed material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere.
Just a shame..
She will be sent back :/ Fast delivery and good craftsmanship.
The jacket makes a great impression.
We were surprised by the good processing.
You can wear them well from both sides.
We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled.
She usually wears size 158, but the size 36 fits her well in this case and will surely be worn for the next year as well.
We can recommend an order.
Robust quality I chose the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal.
Unfortunately, I miscalculated and the edition doesn't quite fit.
But that is my mistake.
I then slightly changed it so that it fits.
The cover appears very robust and no longer damages the edges.
You can use the nut or the entire surface.
Worked without any problems.
Nothing slips anymore.
I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year.
The product itself is quite okay, but not recommended for under a year.
Since the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth.
We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of its size.
Now, after 12 months, we have taken him out again and he can use it.
Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with its few existing teeth.
And when he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately returns
I seem to have been dazzled here by the sometimes exuberant reviews.
I would like to point out that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use.
A very large (for storing equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important everyday things that you just take with you.
Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro bag has now become permanently too small and I need a replacement.
During Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase as I had read many of the reviews beforehand.
When the backpack arrived yesterday, there was disappointment.
The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that.
But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products sold at much higher prices ....
People, that's simply not true!
I was really hoping that it is like that, but there can really be no talk of it.
The padded walls are significantly thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro.
Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more flimsy.
Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro.
Even the zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly high quality.
Therefore, I have decided that the backpack will be returned.
If I invest in equipment costing several thousand euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend money on a decent backpack.
Quality apparently does have its price here.
For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me.
And it's not that the decision was difficult for me either.
When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it would be returned.
What I liked is the color inside.
Here you will definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior.
For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part.
So far, I had liked the Electrics series by E. L. Todd the most, but my opinion was revised with this book.
I found the first two books to be very powerful and also recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part.
The entire part is about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out.
Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to themselves, and then behaves like a little child and withdraws during every argument?!
At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor was interested in him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and he heard it himself.
But at the beginning of the third part, it seems like Volt has forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor.
I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary.
I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex.
That would bring back more tension to the story.
God Human destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and doesn't learn.
First of all:
The movie is not that bad as many people write.
Sure, of course, the story is totally fabricated and always designed according to the same formula.
If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is.
And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, doesn't appreciate anything, and doesn't learn from it!
And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us!
Therefore, Jurassic World:
Fallen
Kingdom is really well made.
It is just a pity that people simply don't get the message behind the movie, despite it being a mainstream film.
We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves.
Out of greed for wealth and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance!
Empathy for the environment and living beings: missing.
4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always follows the same principle, otherwise there could have been 5 stars.
Still well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film like 8 Mile here.
This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be one.
This film is primarily "French", furthermore it is calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes one cry if one engages with it and expects nothing from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, forget about the orange, but that doesn't matter either.
5 days every morning a little package: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing.
My waist circumference has increased by 12 cm!
Flatulence like never before!
Afterwards, diarrhea 5-8 times a day.
Not very helpful, unfortunately despite stopping immediately, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week.
It should be noted that for the smaller packaging size, only 2 stars were given (unfortunately noticed too late), while for the larger one, a full 5 stars were given.
This is very very strange!
terrible smell and poor outcome!
I dyed my blond hair chocolate brown in October with an intensive tint, and in February/March
I used this hair color remover.
I have used the product twice.
The first time I noticed immediately that it smells terribly!
However, there was still a not too bad result, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (slightly darker) color.
Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it one more time, as stated in the instructions, even if the results were not satisfactory.
This time was pure waste of time!
It made no difference, my hair looked the same as in the first attempt.
What was the worst, it still smelled weeks after application..
No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended.
I have been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, always one tablet every 5 days.
My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional prolonged illness.
I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through healthy nutrition but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2.
This works very well.
I feel fitter and much more comfortable.
I sleep better and get up easier.
The price is also great because you have to consider how long you can take the tablets.
Highly recommended.
Function not quite flawless !!!
After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following severe defects which I find very annoying:
1) The case has difficulties connecting with the phone over time.
This means that the device will not turn on even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds.
When you remove the phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but a new defect arises as a result.
2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone into the case, the cover has worn out so much that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times.
Although there aren't many major flaws, I believe that a case with a battery should function perfectly in its purpose, and therefore I am very disappointed in the product for the cost of 30€, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing.
I don't know how all these good ratings come about.
Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth that you receive as a gift in a slightly smaller size at every optician's.
The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and not better.
I expected much more from these towels, it is really very very thin.
Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it.
I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side.
The price for these wipes is excessive; one should not pay more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker that I got as a promotional gift unfortunately broke.
Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I've dropped it in the shower already), produces bass as bass should, Bluetooth works great...
Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off..
it can play sound very loud...
yeah.. what I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker.
As I said, the bass is played as bass and not converted into a higher frequency.
However, this causes a problem.
Some frequencies are played back very loudly, while others remain very quiet.
While some frequencies of the song almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough.
My old speaker may not have reproduced bass well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in terms of volume.
Unfortunately, that's not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying.
So I have to deduct one star for that.
I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
At a few places, the paint had chipped off and when you just went over it with your hand, the paint also came off at some spots.
We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense.
They would only replace the damaged parts, but how when both dressers were damaged.
Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money.
A praise to Amazon Dear spend a little more money.
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality.
Individual parts will be delivered, which you have to glue together yourself.
The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard.
There was no further protection.
Since the mailman stuffed the product downright into my mailbox, a few templates got damaged.
I did not complain about it, as I urgently needed this product.
The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but it sticks well like chewing gum that doesn't harden.
Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick.
Since the adhesive does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one must be very careful not to glue everything together.
The templates are partially incompletely punched out.
For single use and as a joke for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding I would invest more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not unhappy.
The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very clear.
+ Magnetic closure + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf board can be positioned arbitrarily Doors slam due to magnets (maybe can be compensated with rubber pads) some unclean spots.
Supplied dowels are too small and wobbly (didn't have any others and there was also no glue in the house, glued them firmly with craft glue) the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (wrapped them with some paper and balanced them).
Conclusion:
If he didn't look so good and have such good measurements, I would give fewer stars because you have to make everything fit to be truly satisfied.
Also, I find it a bit too expensive.
The coffee tastes good to me....but.
...there are only 3 stars.
The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive).
In that case, I would have given 5 stars.
Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!).
The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a deduction of one star for me.
I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up.
But: the natural sounds sound awful, and extremely loud as well.
I couldn't make them quieter either.
Probably a defect, allegedly that is possible.
The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed.
In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand.
I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow.
However, when the sunrise simulation actually started, it was immediately too bright for me.
I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately, the colored light cannot be dimmed.
I also liked that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time don't have to be re-entered in case of a power outage.
But returned for the reasons mentioned.
Lighting superb, processing insufficient.
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps.
Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four because the other two were delivered without a frame instead, at this point a circuit board is laughing at me...
There was also nothing in the box.
"6 zahlen 4 erhalten" is not a good deal.
Certainly, Amazon would have handled it leniently and quickly, but I only realized this after the return deadline.
So I see that as my mistake and live with it.
However, it is not a good indicator for the quality of these light bulbs so far the only reason for deducting two stars.
The light itself is great.
The rooms are now very bright and uniformly illuminated.
The light color tends more towards cold white.
Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc.
For living spaces, I would personally opt for warmer light.
Comparable to a good old 100 watt light bulb.
However, other lamps can do that as well and perhaps I can also get intact copies there according to the order.
If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating.
I try to answer questions quickly.
Great I received gestures yesterday, and I would like to share my first impression.
Yes, positive.
I have thought long about whether to order this set or not.
The material is stable and it feels good in the hand.
The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them up.
The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical for use on pans with coating.
They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉.
They do not transfer the heat and can therefore be touched directly.
The dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone.
But shortly after wiping and they're gone.
Finally, I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
B-ware sold as new goods Amazon Prime shipping is simply excellent.
Delivery within 24 hours.
Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.
We found that the part has already been installed before.
We have found significant scratches and abrasions on all parts of the assembly.
The connections of the hoses were all damaged.
Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately).
Only now did we see that there are also scratches / streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself.
This item has probably already been delivered and returned.
We will keep this tap and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there.
Our conclusion;
We will never order such goods through Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get proper merchandise.
I just find it sad that customers are being screwed over like this!!
Product itself top, external sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product.
The installation was very easy, and the range is very good, there are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside.
I find the design of the device appealing.
It is kept very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame.
The only annoying thing is that after about.
The thermometer seems to be intact, plausible values are still being displayed here.
The hygrometer, on the other hand, is most likely broken because it always displays completely astronomical values for the external air humidity.
That is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected location and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak grass catcher.
Apart from the fact that the first attempt of delivery is still happily traveling through the country with Hermes, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always.
The lawnmower arrived quickly at my place and made a solid impression.
The engine is powerful and it results in a nice cut.
The volume is not particularly impressively low, but okay.
The large downside is unfortunately the catch basket.
On the one hand, it is made of hard plastic only at the top and bottom, and in between it is made of fabric.
If you only briefly put it down while it's full, then it will naturally be compressed and parts of the content will fall out.
Even worse is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the catch basket is only half full.
That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from there.
Emptying the basket at a large lawn area when it is only half full cannot be the solution.
Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and returned it.
Conclusion:
Basically a very good mower, but due to the unfortunate construction of the grass catcher, it becomes unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring.
I have two of these devices.
The device can be easily integrated through the app.
The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, and can also be extended if needed.
The device is solidly constructed.
Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery power, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app.
For the following reasons, I am only giving 4 stars.
The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again fiddly.
One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls.
This device loses the connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks.
Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it close to the router.
You have to remove the batteries and then reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects again.
This should actually work without removing the battery.
There is always an alarm when the connection is lost.
The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY.
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects.
Unfortunately, I have not yet succeeded in properly leveling the hotbed.
The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there, and on the front right, the screw is practically coming out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low.
The bars that hold the cart are straight, as is the table.
Maybe someone knows what to do there, because like this it is impossible to print anything.
Regarding the setup:
The setup was quite easy, one could only demonstrate how to lay the cables because otherwise they have to be laid again several times, which is very strenuous.
I have already contacted support, but after one week of waiting, I still haven't received a response.
Unfortunately, returning back is no longer possible.
I had expected a little more.
Robust and precise I am positively surprised My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be bought.
This one makes a very sturdy impression and is equally precise after several test measurements.
Two batteries are included so that you can start right away.
The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose.
Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods.
I can only give full points for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper.
There is a clear recommendation to buy from me and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor Bought the bracelet and haven't worn it yet, as it emits a disgusting odor.
Until today, this smell has not gone away, even though it has been "aired out" constantly.
After return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it.
Do not buy it Price ok The stars and spheres on this necklace have grown a bit too large for my liking, making it appear quite heavy.
The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice.
However, the chain is overall very simply processed, so that I have already ripped the closure open twice.
So far, I have been able to repair it over and over again, but I think that won't last long.
But for the affordable price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry.
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds!
You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!
I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more supple.
Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately garbage!
I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it is used goods.
The base station was okay.
Now to the function:
Only connects after some experimenting....
If you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed and reinserted a battery from the base station did the transmitters finally connect.
Unfortunately, my joy did not last long because the connection was lost again after only one hour, despite the fact that the transmitters were right next to the base station.
Also, the display of the three channels was very different!
Overall, not useful for me!
The thing went back!
Would definitely advise against a purchase, only brings trouble!
Transportation damage
Transportation damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off.
I only bought them again for one reason, I needed them urgently because of the current drought, and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit.
I hope that the wave at the previous pump had a production error and that the current pump will perform its services a little longer.
The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in the future than just using a thin-walled box.
I kept the pump anyway, as described above, because I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect its performance.
Could have been thought through better.
Since I frequently deal with many different keys, I thought that having an organizer would be more convenient than constantly carrying around a huge keychain.
At first, everything went quite well.
However, the paint quickly started to come off and the screws had to be tightened constantly.
Nice that it also works with a one-cent coin, but only with a one-cent coin.
I did not find a suitable slot screwdriver that would not immediately ruin the entire screw.
Now, to get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys.
It is nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes and wenig is alles zusammenschaufelt.
Once the lengths are adjusted, it is important to have the whole thing screwed together before you will need a pair of pliers to take it apart again.
Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance, and dexterity.
Finally, the third time I was assembling it, the screw broke off in the thread and therefore the whole thing is useless.
Conclusion:
If at all, then only for once with all necessary keys and never again, but at this price, one can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions.
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks sturdy and all of this in featherweight.
Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after its first use.
In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than stated.
At the moment, I can't really imagine everything there, for example.
If necessary, the really big parts can be put directly into the suitcase, just like before.
It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller pouches/bags.
Not high-quality processed, but I still wanted to mention that.
I personally don't mind that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of a different material than the other bags.
I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that is ok.
So lala Also, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well.
Now, as I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore.
Battery?
Exchanged.
But it still doesn't work.
So I could have just thrown the money directly into the garbage bin.
Care is always good!
The application is easy, but one should be very careful when approaching the brush in order not to damage the needle.
I could not hear an improvement in sound quality with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected.
Two black cables were included.
Battery life lasts for a very long time.
Definitely completely sufficient sound.
I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable.
The ear cups are very soft and comfortable to wear.
The weight is also kept very low.
Purchase recommendation in this price range.
Stylish dress
Very beautiful dress, which is wearable for a variety of occasions.
The price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I got it in a flash sale.
It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as recommended).
I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you don't have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture).
But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off.
It can't get any worse.
I really and seriously did not expect that such garbage is being sold nowadays.
The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop.
It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power.
However, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible.
DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized as maximally unreliable.
The discs must be inserted several times, afterwards it makes rattling noises like those heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90s.
After minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will happen anymore, or the disc will finally be recognized.
But you must never press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything at all.
This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze.
In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included.
If you purchase PowerDVD or similar additional software for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it should, but it is not pretty.
First and foremost, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually a deception, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port.
The other plug is only for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless.
I didn't know that at the time of purchase, which is why I was a little disappointed.
I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs.
But apart from the visual appearance and my misjudgment, the extension fulfills its duty very reliably.
And because of the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick does not simply dangle around like with a regular extension cord.
So not a real bad purchase, but my enthusiasm is limited :-).
Small but mighty!
I bought this product to have an audio output and connect a display to my iPad (Pro).
With iOS 12, it is now possible to move data back and forth.
This works very well.
Furthermore, the audio output was as expected.
Other adapters that I also had to return unfortunately could not do this.
The HDMI output is practical.
I now have a PS4 controller connected via Bluetooth to the tablet and that is connected via HDMI to the TV.
Simultaneous charging is not a problem.
Sound is delivered via HDMI.
What else do I use my PlayStation for :P
There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet.
This one is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic mounting.
With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter.
Well, it holds securely like that and has contact from there...
Overall, somewhat expensive but justified by the full range of functions.
Also very small the whole thing and made stable in an aluminum piece.
Price-performance ratio is good.
Lots of power
Top device.
Has been running without any problems for months.
It's not easy or quiet, but it packs a punch.
I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) to be rather cool and therefore I always use level 2.
It has also fallen multiple times onto the tiled floor and has survived it well.
And I also like the simple design.
Competing products sometimes tend to look like spaceships.
Very good.
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression.
In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed.
Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised.
In live mode, the tracking is accurate to approximately 0.5 meters.
In offline mode when the dog is inside the house, he likes to jump a few meters, but it's not disturbing.
I would buy him back anytime.
However, what would be great is a battery that lasts longer.
Currently, he lasts about 1.5 hours per day.
A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great here.
There is indeed an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so the battery wouldn't have to last at all and we also find daily changing impractical.
One should engage with the dog and not with its collar :-) .
The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks trash
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes.
They fit well and also seem to be comfortable.
However, the lifespan is increasingly decreasing.
Although my son only wears the shoes for physical education class, the sole already breaks after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore.
With the last pair, it was the same in normal use that they didn't last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.
The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly but original?
My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones.
Unfortunately, these look poorly processed at first glance.
They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before.
At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, one can see that the edges are poorly finished and the ankle strap is quite loose, and most likely will not last five years like my previous ones.
I am excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here yet, I was initially very skeptical.
However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I decided to give it a try and ordered them anyway.
The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump.
About the mattress:
I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing purposes.
I noticed that there is some mold on one side.
I wiped it off and hope that this doesn't reappear.
A lie test was conducted directly in the inflated state.
It is comfortable to lie on and fits perfectly for the festival.
Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury.
The mattress fits perfectly into my car.
Before, we removed the seats in the back.
Thus it fits perfectly.
The air pump:
The air pump has different adapters.
The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump.
The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter.
However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint).
Since my friend is skilled at crafts, he was able to repair it and once assembled again, the good part worked excellently and quickly inflated the mattress.
Overall, I am very impressed with the mattress.
I'm curious about the acid test at the festival.
I hope that it doesn't lose any air and also lasts a long time.
Similarly, that the mold does not reappear.
After the test, I can already recommend it.
If I should have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
1. 1.
Very bad
Definitely not worth more than 10€...
Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me.
2.
For the idea of the toy.
Unfortunately, the calendar is torn across several doors directly on day 1 due to shoddy processing.
The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that the car has to be taken apart again to attach the parts.
After the car is fully assembled, parts fall off while playing.
Mostly the windshield.
In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and also not recommend it to anyone else.
The manufacturer may reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and improve it.
A real drone I am fascinated by the drone.
My 7-year-old daughter is flying with it.
Inside, it flies very well and lasts 5 minutes.
Flight times are usually sufficient.
I expected that hair would get tangled in it and the drone would break very quickly at this price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether on tiles or carpet, are no problem.
For questions, please contact us kindly.
Game okay but only playable with the force of Steam.
Did not see when purchasing that it is not a game CD but just a code with which you can download the game.
That would still be okay, but you are forced to install Steam in order to even be able to play it, which is outrageous.
Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which would not be the case with a clean installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the clock.
Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without any problems.
Service went well.... and yet I'm still returning it.
The big drawback: the battery and its runtime.
Charged in the evening, only placed on the shelf overnight, and 11% less battery in the morning without usage.
Many messages came during the day, the battery was already empty by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore.
Therefore not useful for me.
Very unfortunate.
Noble case with limitations
For the sleek Samsung Galaxy S10+, it is imperative to get a case.
I recently liked cases into which you can also insert the credit card.
This offers the case here.
If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much and the lid stands slightly high.
One is enough for me.
The leather case gives a sturdy impression and seems to be well made.
She looks noble.
The mobile phone is surrounded by a case, unlike many other cases, only the connectors have openings.
Otherwise, the power button and volume controls can be easily operated through the case.
The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case.
Even on the TORRO leather QI charging station, it's not possible.
Accessories like the Galaxy Buds can only be charged when the case is off.
Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film 1.
Fits very well and can also be easily pulled up.
The material feels pleasant in the hand and does not get dirty.
A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio.
This case gives the phone some grip.
It is not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone.
Overall, a good purchase.
