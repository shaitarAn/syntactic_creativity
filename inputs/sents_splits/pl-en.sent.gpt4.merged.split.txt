He looks at the family, all little girls, a mother with a baby on her breast just clumsily getting off the wagon and the wagoner is rushing her because the wagon has to go back for others in the suburbs.
The bundle she had on her back drops, and a few grayed-out rags and a single string of tiny, darkened beads spill out from it.
The woman collects them embarrassed, as if she had just revealed her most inaccessible secrets to the world.
Deymowa passes her and suddenly a little boy, maybe six or seven years old, approaches her.
Looking at her with smiling eyes, very pleased with himself, he says: "Praised be Jesus Christ!"
She responds automatically, yet solemnly: "Forever and ever, amen."
And already she feels a clutch in her heart and tears well up in her eyes.
She leans towards the boy, grabbing his wrists, and he looks straight into her tear-filled eyes, still smiling, a little rascal.
The first buildings loom before them suddenly, without warning.
You can see the fog changes the sense of distance, because even Kaśka herself seems surprised by this.
Suddenly it jumps, jerking the bridle, and if it weren't for Roshek's firm reaction and his whip, it would have overturned the carriage.
Maybe the sparks flying from the hearth frightened Kasia, or the unease of horses waiting for their turn to be shod...
Everywhere is filled with the sickly smell of malt, penetrating every product laid out for sale.
You can eat it like bread.
In the suburbs of Rohatyn, in Babintsy, there are several small breweries, from there this satisfying scent spreads throughout the entire neighborhood.
Many stalls here sell beer, and the better shops have both vodka and mead in stock, mainly trojniak.
The store of the Jewish merchant Wakszul offers wine, real Hungarian and true Rhine, and a slightly sour one that they bring here all the way from Wallachia.
There would be the most to say about the Wołowski family, as it has grown to enormous sizes.
Almost all branches of this family have been ennobled, some were of the Bawół coat of arms, others of the Na Kaskach coat of arms.
Undoubtedly, Franciszek, the son of Izaak Wołowski, the same person whom Father Chmielowski called Jeremiah, made a great career.
He was born in 1786 in Brünn and raised in Offenbach, he became one of the best lawyers and a law expert of his time.
Interestingly, when a proposal to grant Polish citizenship to Jews appeared in the parliament, Franciszek as a deputy was arguing in his compelling speech that it is not yet time for such a step.
First, the Polish nation must fight for independence, and then it will be time for social reforms.
All Offenbach neophytes were buried in the city cemetery, which after years began to interfere with the city's expansion plans and was closed down in 1866.
The bones of the people buried there were collected and respectfully reburied in another place.
On this occasion, the skull of Jakub Frank was removed from the grave and, carefully described as the "skull of a Jewish patriarch", ended up in the hands of a city historian in Offenbach.
Many years later, under unknown circumstances, she ended up in Berlin, where she underwent detailed measurements and examinations and was deemed an example of the Jewish racial minority.
After the war, it vanished without a trace, possibly destroyed in the chaos of war, crumbled into dust, or still lying in the underground storage of some museum.
After Jakub's death, a time of great peace came for me.
My main activity became studying the merkavah, and in addition to that, there were our conversations with Jeruchim Dembowski, since we lived in the same room, which brought us closer together.
To him, to Jeruchim, I also told about Chai Szor that she was the only woman I could love and I loved from that beautiful moment when I had her for one night, when I arrived with the news about Jakub to Rohatyn.
But above all, I loved Jakub.
They were in Ivano from April.
If it weren't for the good people of Ivan, they would probably have starved to death.
Fasting saved their lives and health, Bejla now feels better and does not cough as much anymore.
Srol believes that once they are baptized, they will be just as well off as Christians.
They will get a piece of land, Bejla will have vegetables in the garden, and he, Srol, will weave rugs, because he's good at it.
In old age, when the girls are married off, they will take them in.
These are all his dreams.
Look, benefactor, Kaśka doesn't want to go, says Roszko grimly when the carriage stops.
Roszko gets off the goat and says goodbye several times with great flourish.
Then he leaned over and peered into the fog, as if looking into water.
From under his festive red, albeit a bit faded jacket, a shirt sticks out.
I don't know where to go, he says.
How do you not know?
"But we are already on the Rohatyn road," says the surprised priest.
And yet!
She gets out of the wheelchair and follows the servant, helplessly circling the carriage, straining her eyes into the whiteness.
They seem to think they see something, but eyes that cannot latch onto anything start to play tricks on themselves.
I can't believe something like that happened to them!
After all, it's like getting lost in one's own pocket.
Quiet!
Suddenly the priest says and raises his finger up, listening carefully.
And indeed, somewhere on the left, from the foggy furls, comes the soft murmur of water.
Let's follow that noise.
The priest decides where the water flows.
Soon the priest relaxes in the carriage, stretches his legs out in front of him and lets his eyes wander over the sea of fog.
They immediately fall into a traveling reverie, because a person thinks best on the move.
Slowly, reluctantly, the mechanism of his mind comes to life, surprising gears and cogs in motion, setting the driving wheels in movement just like in the clock that stands in his presbytery's hallway, purchased in Lviv; he paid heavily for it.
The chime will ring in a moment.
One begins to wonder if the world did not emerge from such a mist.
After all, the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius maintains that the world was created in the autumn, during the autumnal equinox.
One might think so because there were fruits in paradise; since the apple was hanging on the tree, it must have been autumn...
There is some truth in this.
But then another thought comes to his mind:
What kind of argument is this?
Could not the almighty God create such poor fruits extra, at any time of the year?
When they reach the main road leading to Rohatyn, they join the stream of pedestrians, horse riders and various types of carts emerging from the fog, like figurines made out of bread for Christmas.
It's Wednesday, market day in Rohatyn, peasant carts loaded with bags of grain, cages of poultry, all sorts of agricultural produce are moving.
Among them, briskly marching merchants carry all kinds of goods from their stalls, cleverly now folded up to be carried on their backs like yokes, and in a moment they will become tables full of colorful materials, wooden toys, eggs bought in villages for a quarter of the price...
Peasants also lead goats and cows for sale, the frightened animals, terrified by the noise, take refuge in puddles.
Their speeding wagon, covered with a hole-ridden tarp, is full of noisy Jews who are coming from all over to the fair in Rohatyn.
Behind them struggles a wealthy carriage, which finds it hard to maintain its dignity in the fog and crowd on the road its shiny lacquered doors are black with mud.
The face of the coachman in his blue cloak seems sluggish apparently he did not expect such chaos and is now desperately looking for an opportunity to get off this devilish road.
