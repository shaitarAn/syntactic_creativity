The most important thing that happened to me in the winter of 1993 was that my father came back, just the week before my mother's wedding.
One afternoon in December, he came to the school looking for me.
I ran all the way to the entrance and from behind the iron bars, I could see him standing outside, smoking.
I was wearing a black long coat, with the collar standing up to cover half of my face.
For some reason, I couldn't even make out his features, but I could tell that he was not doing well.
My heart ached and tears rolled down my cheeks.
I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.
Perhaps deep down, I thought she must have been suffering the same way I was, due to my father's departure.
Besides, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness.
It may be true, but happiness has the power to find her.
Right?
As a beautiful woman, she didn't have to work so hard; she didn't have to do anything, she just had to stay in one place.
I still remember that winter was particularly long that year—it was already halfway through April, yet the cherry blossoms hadn't bloomed.
The divorce of your parents has taken a toll on your emotions.
We hadn't had any new games in a long time, so in the evenings we would just sit listlessly on the roof of the dead man's tower.
Among the scattered body parts in the courtyard, there were now a few extra arms.
We used hooks to gather them together and arranged them into a statue of the Thousand-Handed Guanyin.
My father, in fact, had no idea how to do business, but he went to seek help from a distant cousin.
My grandmother had a younger sister who had gone to Beijing in her youth and later married and had children there.
This cousin of hers was the eldest son in the family, and had always been an outcast in the entire family.
You just said that everyone has a time of departure, and life suddenly seems to be harnessed.
I must have been eight years old.
That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
From then on, I no longer had a home.
I had no intention of keeping the appointment.
No matter the reason, I don't think there's any need for us to meet again.
I was sitting on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, when the door suddenly creaked open.
The sky was getting darker and darker.
The water delivery boy stood at the gate with a bucket of water, saying he was going to deliver it to a family in the western suburbs.
He wore a dirty gray woolen cap and had a dazed expression.
Our conversation was difficult.
Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart being crushed and just wanted the meeting to end quickly.
You seem to have noticed, but are still trying to find something to talk about.
The tea had cooled, and the white mist in the room had dissipated.
You finally got up to take your leave.
Just as I shut the door, I felt a sense of relief, but then the doorbell rang again.
You stood at the doorway and asked me to come to the Little White Building later.
Before I could refuse, you had already left the building.
I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove.
Half a pot of water had evaporated, and the entire room was filled with white mist.
You sat down awkwardly, watching me pour tea.
"Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?" you asked.
I'm telling you, Grandma has passed away and now I'm living with my aunt.
"She never got married," you asked.
"Hmm."
The white breath coming out of your mouth, the curls of your hair being blown by the wind, the slight trembling of your knees under your coat—all of this made me believe that the you in front of me was real, and not just a continuation of the dream from before.
It had been eighteen years since we had last seen each other, so it was no surprise that we didn't recognize each other.
You had no makeup on, your pale face was a bit swollen, but you still managed to live up to everyone's expectations and became a beauty.
Her small, heart-shaped face was filled with a look of desolation, as if she had been living in a big city for a long time.
You asked me if you looked different than I had imagined.
I smiled, not knowing what to say.
To be honest, I never imagined what you would look like when you grew up.
For me, everything related to you has been put into a file folder and sealed with lacquer.
It may be hurtful to say this, but I really didn't expect to see you again.
I opened my eyes.
You stand at the threshold.
I don't know how long you've been standing there, maybe you even saw me laughing in my sleep.
And the sadness upon waking, the look of utmost weakness.
Cheng
Gong, you called out my name in a low, hoarse voice, as if you hadn't spoken in a long time.
It was about to snow, and the sky was dark and gloomy.
Inside the house, it was pitch black.
The water in the pot was boiling and bubbling.
I looked at you carefully for a while, and was certain that I didn't know you.
But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that the stranger standing across from me was somehow deeply connected to my life.
That feeling gave me a chill down my spine.
I tried hard to recall, the cards of memory flipping over in my mind.
And then you said, you were Li Jiaqi.
