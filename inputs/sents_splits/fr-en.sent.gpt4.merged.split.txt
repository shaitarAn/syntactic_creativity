Two other small photos with scalloped edges, probably dating from the same year, show the same child, but slimmer, in a dress with ruffles and balloon sleeves.
In the first one, she mischievously snuggles against a woman with a massive body, all in one piece in a wide-striped dress, her hair pulled up into large rolls.
On the other hand, she raises her left fist, the right one restrained by the hand of a tall man in a light jacket and pleated trousers, with a nonchalant posture.
The two photos were taken on the same day in front of a low wall topped with a border of flowers, in a paved courtyard.
Above the heads, a clothesline passes on which a pin has remained hooked.
Another photo, signed by the same photographer but the pamphlet paper is more ordinary and the gold edging has disappeared likely destined for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of about four years old, serious, almost sad despite a good chubby face under short hair, separated by a part in the middle and pulled back by hair clips to which ribbons are attached, like butterflies.
The left hand rests on the same carved table, fully visible, in the Louis XVI style.
She appears bulging in her bodice, her pinafore skirt rises in the front due to a prominent belly, perhaps a sign of rickets (around 1944).
The boys were proud to join the regiment and they were considered handsome as soldiers.
On the evening of the review board, they were making the rounds of the cafes to celebrate the glory of being recognized as real men.
Before the regiment, they were still kids and were worth nothing on the job and marriage market.
Afterwards, they could have a wife and children.
The uniform they paraded around the neighborhood during leaves was enshrouding them in patriotic beauty and virtual sacrifice.
The shadow of the victorious fighters, the GIs, hovered around them.
The coarse cloth of the tunic, brushed when one would rise on tiptoe to kiss them, materialized the absolute break between the world of men and that of women.
Seeing them, one felt a sense of heroism.
Under the unchanging, the posters of last year's circus with the photo of Roger Lanzac, the first communion pictures distributed to comrades, the Songwriters' Club on Radio Luxembourg, days were filled with new desires.
On Sunday afternoons, we would crowd around the general electricity store's window to watch the television.
Cafes were investing in buying a station to attract customers.
On the flanks of the hills, motocross tracks meandered and one would watch the deafening machines go up and down all day long.
The growing impatience of commerce with its new buzzwords, "initiative", "dynamism", was shaking up the routine of the cities.
Between the fair and the fete, the commercial fortnight established itself as a springtime ritual.
In the streets of the center, loudspeakers were blaring out encouragements to buy, interspersed with songs by Annie Cordy and Eddie Constantine, to win either the Simca or the dining room.
On the podium, in the town hall square, a local host was making people laugh with jokes from Roger Nicolas and Jean Richard, rallying candidates for the Hook or Double or Quit, just like on the radio.
Seated in a corner of the podium, under her crown, sat the Queen of Commerce.
The merchandise was moving under the colors of the festival.
People would say "it's a change" or "you mustn't stagnate, one becomes dull staying at home".
But they only talked about what they had seen, which could be relived by eating and drinking.
They did not have enough talent or conviction to talk about what they knew but had not seen.
So neither Jewish children boarding trains for Auschwitz, nor the starving dead collected in the morning in the Warsaw ghetto, nor the 10,000 degrees at Hiroshima.
Hence this impression that history classes, documentaries, and films later on would not dispel: neither the crematory ovens nor the atomic bomb were in the same era as black market butter, air raid warnings, and basement raids.
They would shift conversational gears, comparing it to the previous war, the Great one, that of '14, won in blood and glory.
A war of men that the women at the table listened to with respect.
They were talking about the Chemin des Dames and Verdun, about the gassed, the bells of November 11, 1918.
They named villages from which not a single child who had gone to the front had returned.
They contrasted the soldiers in the mud of the trenches with the prisoners of '40, warm and sheltered for five years, who didn't even have bombs dropped on their heads.
They were arguing over heroism and misfortune.
The children weren't listening and hurried to leave the table as soon as they were given permission, taking advantage of the general benevolence of holiday days to engage in forbidden games, jumping on beds and swinging upside down.
But they kept everything.
Beside the fabulous time, whose episodes they would not order for a long time, the Debacle, the Exodus, the Occupation, the Landing, the Victory they found dull that unnamed era in which they were growing up.
They regretted not having been born, or barely born, when they had to leave en masse for the roads and sleep on straw like gypsies.
From this unexperienced time, they would keep a tenacious regret.
The memory of others passed on to them a secret nostalgia for that era they had narrowly missed and the hope of experiencing it one day.
The frenzy that had followed the Liberation was fading.
So people only thought about going out and the world was full of desires to satisfy immediately.
Everything that was happening for the first time since the war was causing a rush, the bananas, the national lottery tickets, the fireworks.
By whole neighborhoods, from the grandmother supported by her daughters to the infant in a stroller, people rushed to the fair, to the torchlight procession, to Bouglione's circus where they nearly got trampled in the commotion.
They flocked in prayerful and singing crowds along the road to welcome the statue of Our Lady of Boulogne and escort it back for miles the next day.
Profane or religious, any occasion was a good reason for them to be outside together, as if they wanted to continue living collectively.
On Sunday evenings, buses would return from the sea with tall young men in shorts singing at the top of their lungs, climbing on the luggage rack.
The dogs roamed freely and mated in the middle of the street.
Family story and social story, it's all one.
The voices of the guests defined the realms of youth: the countryside and farms where, from time immemorial, men had been hired and girls served as maids, the factory where they all met, dated and married each other, the small businesses that were accessed by the most ambitious.
They drew stories without personal events other than births, weddings, and mourning, without trips outside of the regiment to a distant garrison town, existences occupied by work, its harshness and wear, the threats of drinking.
The school was a mythical background, a brief golden age where the teacher had been the stern god with his iron ruler to hit fingers.
From hand to hand, browned photos with backs stained by all the fingers that had held them at other meals were passed around, a blend of coffee and grease melded into an indescribable color.
In the rigid and serious newlyweds, the wedding guests lined up in several rows along a wall, one did not recognize either their parents or anyone.
It was not oneself either that one saw in the semi-naked, gender-indeterminate baby on a cushion, but someone else, a creature belonging to a silent and inaccessible time.
