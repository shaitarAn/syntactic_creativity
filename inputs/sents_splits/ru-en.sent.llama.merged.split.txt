The deafening sea roar never ceased for a minute.
He was advancing in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
And the wind began to rustle in the bare trees, then fell silent, just as I did, listening to the flow of the night.
But he didn't leave, he was here.
I knew it by the smell of damp earth and the faint tremble of a solitary plane tree leaf.
I noticed that stubborn gray sheet during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
Occasionally, from the darkness, from the city, gunshots could be heard.
After each shot, the dogs would bark for a long time.
A dim light flickered and died far out at sea.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and discover many previously unnoticed qualities in them.
Yes, in the damp yellow sandstone, there were many small sea shells embedded in it, and on the bushes, there were still a few colors left, they sat on straight, sturdy stems like damp, crumpled golden butterflies, and patiently waited for the sun.
But it rarely emerged from the fog as a dim white patch and failed to provide either warmth or shade.
Under a single ancient plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, leaves lay scattered, as if cut from dull green velvet.
Along the iron railings, a procession of ants scurried, carrying their last supplies for the winter in their underground dwellings, while a small timid frog lived under the anchor chain.
At night, someone on the other side of the river started flashing a flashlight and shouting prolongedly.
I went out with Uncle Vanya to the shore.
The river roared.
The water flowed through the dam as a cold waterfall.
The night was late, dark, and starless overhead.
The face was splashed with the freshness of the wild, thawed earth.
And all the time, someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other bank, but the words were inaudible over the noise of the river.
When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black.
She stood motionless on the bank.
She saw them taking her father away.
She fell to her knees and dropped her head onto the sand.
No, replied grandfather.
It's true, we haven't seen each other.
Ostap began to go blind.
He decided to go to St. Petersburg then, to see that woman before he became completely blind.
He reached the royal capital and learned that she had died, perhaps unable to bear the separation.
Ostap found her grave at the cemetery, made of white marble stone, he looked, and his heart broke as his iron rose was lying on the stone.
The woman bequeathed to lay a rose on her grave.
Forever..
Alyosha started to boast and, perhaps, died on the road or at the market under a cart.
Amen!
On the other bank, the forbidden forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope.
The sun could not break through the dense foliage of this forest.
Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light break through the dense foliage and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation.
Like sparkling dust particles, small birds flew into this ray of light.
They squealed as they chased after each other and dived into the foliage, as if into green water.
I scooped water from the pond, threw in some grass, and waited.
The red buoys stood motionless in the water.
One of them started to twitch, made light circles, suddenly dived or quickly swam away.
The father was fishing, the line was tightening, the willow branch was bending into an arc, and in the mist over the pond, bubbles began to rise, splashing, and commotion.
Water was splashing, jostling the cups, hastily scurrying in all directions were the water-measuring beetles, and finally, in the mysterious depths, a golden glow began to flicker.
It was impossible to understand what it was until the father pulled out a heavy carp from the tangled grass.
He lay on his side, exhaled, and waved his fins.
From his scales emanated a wonderful smell of the underwater kingdom.
Yasha thought about himself for seconds.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdza Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium.
In the sanatorium behind high walls and iron gates, we always felt completely safe.
Especially if they didn't light the stove.
As we were passing by the gate, Yasha stumbled.
Afterwards, when we recalled the incident in Sturdza Lane, Yasha insisted that whenever you want to do something in the best possible way, you will inevitably mess up on something trivial.
I thought to myself that Yashin's unbearable gait was to blame for everything.
But I kept silent not to upset Yasha.
We were crawling through the alley.
I said that we should go along the side where the gap is, not stopping short of it, listen carefully, and then quickly and silently pass through the gap.
The calculation, in my opinion, was mathematically accurate.
If there are people in the entrance, they may not notice us.
If we walk on the opposite side of the alley, they may notice us from afar.
I calculated that in the latter case, we will be going against a dangerous current, or rather, we will be in plain sight of the people who have taken cover in the underpass, for five times longer.
And therefore, there will be five times more chances that we will be noticed.
I woke up in the morning to the hot sun beating on the white walls.
The red and yellow marigolds swayed in the open window.
Together with them, I peered into the room where a nasturtium flower was sitting; a furry bee was sitting on it.
I, frozen, watched as she angrily struggled and extricated herself from the tight flower.
Bright streams were running endlessly across the ceiling, light waves of river reflection.
The river murmured here, right next to us.
