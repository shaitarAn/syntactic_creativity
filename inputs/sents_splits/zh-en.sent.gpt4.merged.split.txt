In the winter of 1993, the most important thing for me was that my dad came back, just one week before my mom was to be married.
One afternoon in December, he came to school to look for me.
I dashed towards the main gate and spotted him standing outside smoking, a distance away through the iron railing.
Wearing a black overcoat, the raised collar concealed half of the face.
I don't know why, even though I didn't get a clear look at him, I feel like he's not doing well.
My heart ached, and tears fell from my eyes.
I never thought that my mother would consider remarrying.
Perhaps subconsciously, I feel that she should continue to suffer because of my dad's departure, just like me.
Moreover, I feel that she lacks the ability to find happiness.
Perhaps this is indeed the case, but happiness has the ability to find her.
Isn't it true that as a beautiful person, she doesn't have to work so hard, she doesn't even have to do anything.
All she needs is to just stand there.
I still remember, the winter that year was especially long.
Halfway through April, the spring flowers had not yet bloomed.
The matter of your parents' divorce is making you feel very depressed.
We haven't had any new games for a long time, so when evening comes, we just sit listlessly on the roof of the Dead Man's Tower.
In the yard, several more arms have been added to the scattered body parts.
We used hooks to bring them together and arranged them into a Thousand-Hand Guanyin.
Actually, my father knows nothing about doing business, he just went to seek help from a cousin who he isn't particularly close with.
My grandmother has a sister, who moved to Beijing in her early years.
She later married and had children there.
This cousin is the eldest son of her family, and has always been considered an outcast within the entire clan.
You just said that everyone has a time when their fortune begins, it's as if life suddenly takes the reins.
I think I was about eight years old.
That autumn, Dad left Jinan and went to Beijing alone.
Since then, I haven't had a home anymore.
I don't plan to keep the appointment.
No matter what the reason is, I think there is no need for us to meet again.
I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another.
The sky was getting darker and darker when suddenly there was a firm knock at the door.
The boy carrying the water bucket stood at the doorway, saying he was delivering water to a household in the western suburbs.
He is wearing a dirty, grey wool hat, with a dazed expression on his face.
Our conversation is going very difficultly.
Every time I fall into silence, I feel a pressure on my heart, just wanting to end this meeting quickly.
You seem to have noticed something, but you're still trying to find a topic.
The tea has cooled down, the white mist in the room has completely dispersed, and you finally stand up to take your leave.
I had just closed the door and let out a sigh of relief when the doorbell rang again.
You're standing at the door, asking me to come to the small white building later.
Before I even had a chance to refuse, you had already stepped out of the building.
I walked to the kitchen and turned off the stove.
Half of the water in the kettle has evaporated, filling the entire room with white mist.
You sit down restlessly, watching me pour the tea.
Are you still living with your grandmother and aunt?
You ask.
I told you, grandma has passed away, now I live with my aunt.
"She never settled down," you ask.
Hmm.
The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the curly hair stirred up by the wind, the knees slightly trembling under your coat's hem, these make me believe that you truly exist here and now, not merely an extension of a previous dream.
It's been eighteen years, so it's not strange if you don't recognize me.
You are not wearing makeup, your pale face is a bit swollen, but at least you did not disappoint everyone's expectations and grew up to be a beauty.
It's just that her peach-heart-shaped face is somewhat gloomy, giving off the look of someone who has been in the big city for a long time.
You ask me, are you different from the way I imagined you?
I smiled noncommittally.
To be honest, I have never imagined what you would look like when you grew up.
For me, everything related to you has already been packed into a file bag and sealed with sealing wax.
It might hurt to say this, but honestly, I really have no desire to see you again.
I open my eyes.
You are standing at the door.
I don't know how long you have been standing there, you probably even saw me laughing in my dreams.
There's also the sadness of waking up, the appearance at our weakest moment.
Cheng Gong, you call out my name in a low voice, your voice very hoarse, as if it's been a long time since you last spoke.
It's about to snow, the sky is terribly overcast, and the room is pitch black.
The water on the stove is boiling, gurgling and rolling over.
I looked at you carefully for a while, sure that I don't know you.
But in the dim light, I suddenly felt that this stranger standing opposite me seemed to have a deep connection with my life.
That kind of feeling sends a chill down one's spine.
I am trying hard to recall, with the cards of memory flipping over and over in my mind.
Then you said, you are Li Jiaqi.
