{"translation": "The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment."}
{"translation": "It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes fading away."}
{"translation": "The wind would start to rustle in the bare trees, then die down, just like me, listening to the flow of the night."}
{"translation": "But it didn't go away, it was still here."}
{"translation": "I could tell by the smell of wet gravel and the barely audible quiver of a solitary plane leaf."}
{"translation": "I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only wakeful friend."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, from the darkness, from the city, gunshots could be heard."}
{"translation": "After each shot, dogs would howl for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then, far out at sea, a faint fire would flicker and go out."}
{"translation": "He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before."}
{"translation": "For example, in the rough yellow stone there were many tiny sea shells embedded in it; on the bushes of broom there were still a few flowers, sitting on straight, firm stalks like wet, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun."}
{"translation": "But it rarely shone through the hazy white patch of mist, giving neither warmth nor shade."}
{"translation": "Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, the leaves lay scattered like pieces cut from a dull green velvet."}
{"translation": "A line of ants ran along the iron gate, carrying off to their underground storehouses the last supplies for winter, and under the anchor chain lived a small, timid toad."}
{"translation": "At night, on the other side of the river, someone started to wave a flashlight and shout in a drawn-out voice."}
{"translation": "My uncle Ilko and I went out to the bank."}
{"translation": "The river was roaring."}
{"translation": "The water was flowing through the rapids in a cold waterfall."}
{"translation": "It was a late, silent night, not a single star in the sky."}
{"translation": "The wild freshness of the melted earth blew in our faces."}
{"translation": "And all the time someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other side of the river, but the words could not be distinguished over the noise of the river."}
{"translation": "When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black\u2014the mother."}
{"translation": "She stood motionless on the shore."}
{"translation": "From there she saw her father being carried away."}
{"translation": "Then she knelt down and fell face first onto the sand."}
{"translation": "\"No,\" Grandpa replied."}
{"translation": "\"That's true, they hadn't seen each other."}
{"translation": "Ostop had started to go blind."}
{"translation": "He had decided to go to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind."}
{"translation": "He made it to the imperial capital and found out that she had died\u2014perhaps she couldn't bear the separation."}
{"translation": "Ostop found her grave of white marble and when he looked, his heart broke\u2014there lay his iron rose."}
{"translation": "The woman had bequeathed that a rose be placed on her grave forever."}
{"translation": "And Ostop began to sing and, perhaps, died on the way or at the market under the wagon."}
{"translation": "Amen!"}
{"translation": "On the opposite bank rose the forest of the Countess Branitskaya."}
{"translation": "The sun could not penetrate the thick foliage of this forest."}
{"translation": "Only occasionally a solitary ray would cut through the thicket and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation."}
{"translation": "Like sparkling dust motes, small birds would fly into this ray."}
{"translation": "They would chirp and chase each other and dive into the foliage, as if into green water."}
{"translation": "I would scoop water from the pond, throw in some grass and wait."}
{"translation": "The red floats would stand motionless in the water."}
{"translation": "Then one of them would start to quiver, make small circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away."}
{"translation": "My father would set the hook, the line would tighten, the walnut rod would bend into an arc, and a bubbling, splashing and commotion would begin over the pond."}
{"translation": "The water would ripple, little buckets would be hurriedly paddled away in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glint would appear in the depths."}
{"translation": "It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out onto the grassy bank a heavy carp, gasping for breath."}
{"translation": "It lay on its side, flapping its fins."}
{"translation": "An amazing smell of the underwater kingdom emanated from its scales."}
{"translation": "Yasha counted the seconds in his head."}
{"translation": "We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium."}
{"translation": "Behind the high fence and iron gates of the sanatorium we always felt completely safe, especially if we didn't light any bonfires."}
{"translation": "When we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled."}
{"translation": "Later, when we remembered the incident in Sturdzovskiy Lane, Yasha insisted that if you wanted to do something the best way, you always had to trip up on something insignificant."}
{"translation": "But I thought to myself that it was all due to Yasha's unbearable gait."}
{"translation": "But I kept quiet so as not to upset Yasha."}
{"translation": "We crept along the alley."}
{"translation": "I said we should go on the side of the gateway, stopping short of it, and listen carefully, then quickly and silently pass by the gateway."}
{"translation": "My calculation, it seemed to me, was mathematically precise."}
{"translation": "If there were people in the gateway, they might not notice us."}
{"translation": "But if we went on the opposite side of the gateway, we might be seen from a distance."}
{"translation": "I calculated that in the latter case we would be walking towards the dangerous gateway, or rather, we would be visible to the people hiding in the gateway five times longer."}
{"translation": "And, consequently, there would be five times more chances that we would be noticed."}
{"translation": "In the morning I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls."}
{"translation": "Red and yellow monkshoods swayed at the open window."}
{"translation": "With them peeping into the room was a nasturtium flower; a furry bee was sitting in it."}
{"translation": "I, motionless, watched as it angrily buzzed and made its way out of the tight flower."}
{"translation": "On the ceiling ran endless streams of light, gentle waves\u2014reflections of the river."}
{"translation": "The river was roaring nearby."}
