{"translation": "There are rock pyramids and blocks of rock on the valley floor that temporarily provide the player with protection because they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire."}
{"translation": "The enemy is represented by slowly moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, in addition to speedy rockets that become harder and harder to hit as the game progresses."}
{"translation": "UFOs also appear at periodic intervals."}
{"translation": "They cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can obtain a high score by shooting a UFO."}
{"translation": "The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes."}
{"translation": "They are the attraction mode, game intro mode, playing mode, initial setup for maximum results, and the self-test mode."}
{"translation": "The last operating mode has a special process for testing the operating elements and the computer function."}
{"translation": "4. Gameplay"}
{"translation": "Gameplay is initiated when the START button is pressed."}
{"translation": "The LED switch remains illuminated, and the game sounds become audible."}
{"translation": "If the player's last tank is eliminated by enemy combatants, the game ends."}
{"translation": "The game begins with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen."}
{"translation": "The player can determine the position of each enemy tank or rocket by monitoring the text superimposed in the upper left information display corner of his cockpit."}
{"translation": "A cue can be, for example: ENEMY FROM RIGHT."}
{"translation": "There will also be a dot visible on the expansive radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, which represents the enemy's position."}
{"translation": "The upper conical surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below."}
{"translation": "If the enemy is in this area, it is easy to aim at him on the monitor."}
{"translation": "At the same time, ENEMY IN FIRING RANGE is superimposed in the upper left information display."}
{"translation": "UFOs flying over the battlefield sporadically appear on the monitor."}
{"translation": "They are harmless flying objects observing the battle and cannot eliminate the enemy's or player's tanks."}
{"translation": "The UFOs' flight position cannot be captured by the radar."}
{"translation": "The UFOs are supposed to round out the battle and distract the player because they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets."}
{"translation": "UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's and the enemies' tanks."}
{"translation": "If the player shoots one down, he gets 5,000 points."}
{"translation": "If an enemy is hit, the following points are received:"}
{"translation": "For a slowly moving tank, 1,000 points; for a rocket, 2,000 points; for a super tank, 3,000 points."}
{"translation": "A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or a slowly moving enemy tank."}
{"translation": "Multiple options give the person setting it up the opportunity for gameplay with 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks."}
{"translation": "A bonus tank can also be unlocked after obtaining a predetermined number of points, and the appearance of rockets can vary for more difficult gameplay."}
{"translation": "Details and the exact switch position of the game's selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration."}
{"translation": "5. Initial entry of high score"}
{"translation": "If a player exceeds the minimum number of points on the high score list, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials on the list after the game ends."}
{"translation": "The instructions for this are self-explanatory, and can be shown in four languages."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that after running a self test, activating the RESET button on the Battlezone analog vector generator PCB, or an electrical outage, the list of high scores will be deleted."}
{"translation": "After deletion (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores and their initials are maintained and are displayed on the screen to challenge other players."}
{"translation": "Each score that is over 100,000 is also marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials."}
{"translation": "Should a player not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes."}
{"translation": "After this, the device will revert to the attraction game mode."}
{"translation": "ASSEMBLY"}
{"translation": "1. New parts"}

{"translation": "INTRODUCTION"}
{"translation": "TO FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games was ignited in me after the rise of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a number of new possibilities and seemed to be a new form of expression to me which could be used to help push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "It represented an opportunity for me to open up new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematic pioneer in the early 20th century:"}
{"translation": "While I struggled with the untested technology, I knew that everything was still left to discover especially a new language, which was to be both narrative and visual."}
{"translation": "To be completely honest, the next 10 years weren't able to satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "I had a nagging feeling that video games were only satisfying a small part of their vast creative potential because they were more focused on \"action\" and were therefore forgetting a fundamental element of the human experience: emotions."}
{"translation": "In the meantime, the technology continued to rapidly progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a real form of expressing emotions."}
{"translation": "Even though this could have naturally happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are asked, and specific answers are provided."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that isn't only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark hallways and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but it contains much more sophisticated and meaningful content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer gaming content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will have fun with this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are somewhat skeptical of video games, I hope that Fahrenheit changes your views on this."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative journey and enrich it with their own inspiration, their talent, and ambition."}
{"translation": "Interactivity is still in its infancy and still offers the opportunity to discover everything."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has consumed a large part of our lives and was an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the whole Quantic Dream team, during which we always felt compelled to question many of the principles that had previously been considered unbreakable."}
{"translation": "I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit like with books, movies, and songs that leave a lasting impression on you also doesn't pass you by without leaving an impression on you."}
{"translation": "David Cage"}
{"translation": "THE README FILE"}
{"translation": "A README file that includes the licensing agreement and up-to-date information on the game can be found on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM."}

{"translation": "Because it should fit tight and I didn't want to fight my bust size into an S or M. .."}
{"translation": "In the end, it would have fit in length and hip area."}
{"translation": "I could swim in the rest."}
{"translation": "Additionally, the packing material came out of the packaging upon opening and got everywhere."}
{"translation": "It's simply a shame."}
{"translation": "It will be sent back :/"}
{"translation": "Fast delivery and good manufacturing"}
{"translation": "The jacket made a good impression."}
{"translation": "We were surprised by the good workmanship."}
{"translation": "You can wear it well from both sides."}
{"translation": "We ordered it for our daughter, she was completely thrilled."}
{"translation": "She usually wears a 158 and in this case, the 36 fit her very well and she will certainly be able to wear it next year, too."}
{"translation": "We can recommend ordering it."}
{"translation": "Robust quality"}
{"translation": "I opted for rubber cover c because I always work with wood on the jack, and that's not the best."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I mismeasured and the cover doesn't fit exactly."}
{"translation": "But that is my fault."}
{"translation": "So I made a slight change so it fits."}
{"translation": "The cover seems very durable and you can't damage the edges anymore."}
{"translation": "You can use the nut or the whole surface."}
{"translation": "Worked without a problem."}
{"translation": "It no longer slips."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again in a heartbeat."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, too big for under 1 year"}
{"translation": "This product itself is quite okay, although not less than one year."}
{"translation": "The surface is way too big for a small mouth to chew."}
{"translation": "We got it when our son was 7 months and we couldn't use it because of the size."}
{"translation": "Now, at 12 months, we took it out again to try and he can use it."}
{"translation": "With his few teeth he hasn't been able to bite anything."}
{"translation": "And after it has been in the refrigerator, it calms him a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality unsatisfactory / Unfortunately, goes back"}
{"translation": "Here, I have allowed myself to be dazzled by the sometimes-exaggerated reviews."}
{"translation": "I would like to say in advance, that I already use 2 Lowepro backpacks."}
{"translation": "One is very large (to store equipment), and a fairly small one for the most important everyday items that you usually take with you."}
{"translation": "Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2. 8, the smaller Lowepro is now too small, and I needed a replacement."}
{"translation": "On Prime Day, I got this backpack for a really affordable price (about 29 euros) and I was actually very happy with this purchase, if only I had read some of the reviews first."}
{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: the backpack is not bad for less than 30 euros, you can't say that."}
{"translation": "But that it (as was written in many of the reviews) can be compared to well-known products that are sold for much higher prices ."}
{"translation": "People, that is simply not true!"}
{"translation": "I was really hoping that this would be true, but that is not true."}
{"translation": "The padded sides are much thinner and do not offer as much protection as my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "And the dividers inside are of a different caliber and considerably sloppier."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Ever the zippers and the materials used in the compartments for the small items, aren't even high quality."}
{"translation": "That is why I have decided to return the backpack."}
{"translation": "When I purchase equipment for many thousands of euros, then I should also spend money on a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "In this case quality also apparently has a price."}
{"translation": "For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, this is probably a good backpack, just not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's not like this was a hard decision for me to."}
{"translation": "As I was unpacking the backpack, I knew in about 2 minutes that it would be going back."}
{"translation": "What I really liked, was the color of the interior."}
{"translation": "I'm sure you can find things a lot faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different requirements for a backpack, this backpack is certainly a good thing; however, mine is going back."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed by the third part"}
{"translation": "Up to now, I liked the electric series from E. L."}
{"translation": "Todd the best; however, I have changed my mind with this book."}
{"translation": "I thought the first two books were really good and worth recommending and I was really looking forward to the third installment."}
{"translation": "This installment is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I thought it was unnecessarily drawn out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything, and every time there's an argument he acts like a little kid and he just leaves?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second installment, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said that Taylor liked him and tried to convince Taylor's ex that Taylor could not live without him and he had heard this himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third installment, it appears that Volt has forgotten all of this and fights for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped, that this was the last installment in the series, and I think this installment in the series is the weakest and at the same time very unnecessary."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, I will read the fourth installment and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring back more suspense to the story."}
{"translation": "Man ruins everything, does not appreciate anything, and does not learn anything!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not aaaas bad as many write."}
{"translation": "Obviously, the story is completely made up, and always follows the same concept F."}
{"translation": "Once you have seen the beginning, you know what the ending is."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything, and does not learn anything!"}
{"translation": "And that is exactly what the movie wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "How often did I think while watching this movie ( and that even though I know that it is only a movie, and the animals are computer generated) :"}
{"translation": "Oh my God, the poor animals, it made me tear up a lot."}
{"translation": "That is why Jurassic World:"}
{"translation": "Fallen Kingdom is really well made."}
{"translation": "It is only a shame that people do not understand the message behind the movie, even though it is a mainstream movie."}
{"translation": "We are consistently destroying animals and the environment and in the end our planet and ourselves."}
{"translation": "From greed and profiteering, and from stupidity and arrogance!"}
{"translation": "Sympathy for the environment and living things :wrong."}
{"translation": "4 stars, because the movie well made, but unfortunately, made with the same principles, otherwise, it would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Still a well-made popcorn movie."}
{"translation": "a quiet, sensitive movie"}
{"translation": "Some expect this movie to be like 8 Mile."}
{"translation": "This movie is no Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't even want to be one."}
{"translation": "Above all, this movie is \"French\" besides, it is quiet, sensible, sensitive, authentic, and will move you to tearsif you allow yourself to be engaged and don't expect it to be something it doesn't want to be."}
{"translation": "Problematic"}
{"translation": "Taste like Quench from the '90s, officially orange, but that doesn't matter."}
{"translation": "A pack every morning for 5 days:"}
{"translation": "Nothing has moved, but nothing has gone in."}
{"translation": "My waist has grown 12 cm!"}
{"translation": "Flatulence like never before!"}
{"translation": "Followed by diarrhea"}
{"translation": "5-8 times a day."}
{"translation": "Not helpful, unfortunately, in spite of stopping immediately, the diarrhea has continued for 1 week."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that the smaller package size only got 2 stars (unfortunately saw that too late) the larger a full 5?"}
{"translation": "That is very very unusual!"}
{"translation": "a horrible smell and minor results!"}
{"translation": "In October, I colored my blond hair chocolate brown with an intensive coloring, in February/March I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I used the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible!"}
{"translation": "But the results weren't too bad, it turned out more of a chestnut brown (a little darker)."}
{"translation": "Since it did not meet my expectations, I used it, as described in the directions for non-satisfactory results, a second time."}
{"translation": "This time was a pure waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It didn't make a difference; my hair looked the same as it did after the first attempt."}
{"translation": "The worst part was how badly it smelled even weeks after use."}
{"translation": "It did not matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just did not go away."}
{"translation": "Very recommendable"}
{"translation": "I have been taking the pills for a long time now and always one pill every 5 days."}
{"translation": "My vitamin levels had been low for a long time because of my job, too little exercise, and another long-term illness."}
{"translation": "So I wanted to boost my immune system not just through healthy eating, but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2."}
{"translation": "This worked very well."}
{"translation": "I feel fitter and much butter."}
{"translation": "I am sleeping better and it is easier to wake up."}
{"translation": "The price is excellent when you think about how long you can take the pills."}
{"translation": "Absolutely worth recommending."}
{"translation": "Does not work perfectly!!!"}
{"translation": "After using it for 3 months, I detected the following major defects in the battery case which I find to be very annoying:"}
{"translation": "1) Over time, the case has a problem \"connecting\" to the cell phone."}
{"translation": "That means that it will not load even though you have pressed the \"Power On/Off\" button for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "When you take the cell phone out of the case and then put it back in, you do solve the problem 70% of the time, but doing so causes another issue."}
{"translation": "2) By taking the cell phone out of its case and putting it back in a lot, the lid gets so worn out, that it falls off of the case by itself, which is why I have almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "These are not really major defects, but I think a case with a battery should work perfectly and that is why I, for a price of 30\u20ac, was very disappointed in this product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months."}
{"translation": "Way too expensive, too thin and disappointing"}
{"translation": "I do not know how all these very good reviews came about."}
{"translation": "After all, it is actually a cleaning cloth for glasses, that you get as a gift, in a somewhat smaller size, from any optometrist."}
{"translation": "The cleaning function is as good as a kitchen towel, and no better."}
{"translation": "I expected much more from these cloths, and it is really very very thin."}
{"translation": "Since I have already used it, I can no longer exchange it;"}
{"translation": "I am very disappointed and for my part, I cannot recommend these cloths; the price of these cloths is way over the top; you shouldn't pay more than 2 euros."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response"}
{"translation": "I purchased this speaker to use in the shower because my smaller, free speaker that I received as a promotional gift unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "In general, the Onforu works well, is waterproof (it has already fallen in the shower), plays bass like bass, Bluetooth works well."}
{"translation": "you of course have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will fall off."}
{"translation": "it can play sound loudly."}
{"translation": "yes."}
{"translation": ". what I am critical of is the frequency response of this small speaker."}
{"translation": "As I said, bass plays as bass and not changed to a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt your ears, you can just barely hear higher and lower frequencies."}
{"translation": "While my old speaker did not play bass like bass, the frequencies were pretty naturally represented in the volume."}
{"translation": "With the Onforu this is unfortunately not the case, which I find to be somewhat annoying."}
{"translation": "That is why I have to take one star away."}
{"translation": "I expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "The color was chipped in a few places and if you just went over it with your hand the color came off right away in some places."}
{"translation": "We wanted it to be picked up for free because we did not want it anymore , but unfortunately only if we paid."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts but what if both dressers were damaged."}
{"translation": "Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of all of this for us and returned our money."}
{"translation": "PRAISE to Amazon"}
{"translation": "Rather spend a little more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is obvious in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered that you have to glue together yourself."}
{"translation": "The product was packed in a simple envelope, that was made out of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no additional protection."}
{"translation": "Since the mail person literally shoved the package into my mailbox, some of the stencils were damaged."}
{"translation": "I didn't complain, because I desperately needed this product."}
{"translation": "The glue provided hardly stuck, but sticks pretty well like chewing gum that does not get hard."}
{"translation": "One day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wood sticks."}
{"translation": "Since the glue material does not dry out (at least it still wasn't dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful to make sure you do not stick everything together."}
{"translation": "Some of the stencils were not completely cut out."}
{"translation": "For a one-time use and as a joke for a party ok, but for a wedding I would invest more money and grab a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "I am not unhappy."}
{"translation": "The cabinet looks good and is easy to build, even if the instructions are not that clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic closure + looks nice + stable once built + shelving can be positioned as desired"}
{"translation": "Doors slam because of magnets (may be able to fix this with rubber stoppers) some unclean spots"}
{"translation": "included anchors are way too small and are loose (I did not have any others and since there was no other trophy in the house, I stuck it together with craft glue) the support for the removable shelf is a little loose (I wrapped paper around it to level it)"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it did not look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give it fewer stars, since you have to adjust everything to really be happy."}
{"translation": "Besides, as a result, I think it is a little too expensive."}
{"translation": "The coffee tastes good to me."}
{"translation": ".but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive)."}
{"translation": "Otherwise"}
{"translation": "I would have given 5*."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee does not run through consistently (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "And the additional plastic garbage (individually wrapped see photo) gets a one-star deduction from me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full points soon."}
{"translation": "Annoys me"}
{"translation": "The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "But: the natural sounds sound terrible, extremely loud as well."}
{"translation": "I also could not set them quieter."}
{"translation": "Possibly likely a defect, since it is allegedly possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I would immediately fall out of bed."}
{"translation": "Additionally, the darkest display setting is so bright, that you can make shadows on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought that it was already morning."}
{"translation": "However, when it was really time for the sunrise simulation to begin, it was immediately too bright for me."}
{"translation": "I thought the colors and the color changes were very nice, but you can unfortunately not dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "I also thought it was good that it has a battery, so that you do not have to reenter the time and alarm time again after a power outage."}
{"translation": "It is went back due to the reasons mentioned previously."}
{"translation": "Light super, workmanship insufficient"}
{"translation": "I have replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lights."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I could only replace four since the others were delivered without mountings instead, a circuit board was laughing at me. .."}
{"translation": "There also wasn't anything in the box."}
{"translation": "\"Buy 6 receive 4\" is not a good deal."}
{"translation": "Certainly, Amazon would have fixed this problem accommodatingly and fast, but I didn't notice it until after the return deadline."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I consider it to be my mistake and will have to live with it."}
{"translation": "Still, it is not a good indicator of the quality of these light bulbs until now the only reason for the two-star deduction."}
{"translation": "The light itself is super."}
{"translation": "The rooms are very bright not and evenly illuminated."}
{"translation": "The light color is more towards a cold white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for a hallway, study, work room, laundry room, etc."}
{"translation": "For living rooms, I would personally get a warmer light."}
{"translation": "Definitely comparable to a good old 100-watt bulb."}
{"translation": "Other lights can do this as well and maybe I will find complete examples of the lights I ordered there."}
{"translation": "Should my review be helpful, then I would be happy to give a positive review."}
{"translation": "I will try to answer any questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I received it yesterday, and would like to share my first impression."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive."}
{"translation": "I thought a long time about whether I should order this set or not."}
{"translation": "The material is stable and it fits well in the hand."}
{"translation": "The utensils all have a whole in the handle so they can be hung up."}
{"translation": "The soft silicon does not scratch expensive cooking pots and pans, and is especially practical to use with pans that have a coating."}
{"translation": "**They are heat resistant and can be used for heats up to 440 \u00b0F."}
{"translation": "**They also don't transfer heat so can be touched directly."}
{"translation": "**The dishwasher does, however, leave water spots on the black silicon sometimes."}
{"translation": "However, just wipe them off soon after washing and they are gone."}
{"translation": "Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend them"}
{"translation": "B-Ware sold as new product"}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime delivery is simply the best."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts."}
{"translation": "While doing this, we determined that various parts had already been installed before."}
{"translation": "On all of the installation parts we had to note all of the scratches and abrasions."}
{"translation": "The threading/hose connections were all damaged."}
{"translation": "In spite of this, we installed this piece in the sink (Unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only then did we see that the chrome faucet itself had visible scratches / smears."}
{"translation": "This part was possibly delivered once and sent back."}
{"translation": "We are keeping this faucet and will install it in the sink in the basement since it does not matter what it looks like there."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion;"}
{"translation": "Never again will we order something like this over Amazon instead we would rather spend a bit more money at a building supply store where we get proper products."}
{"translation": "Just think it's sad that customers are screwed like this!!!"}
{"translation": "Product itself is great, unfortunately, the external sensor broke after 6 months"}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very happy with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very easy from the beginning, and even the band width is very good, and it has absolutely no problem with the communication from the inside to the outside."}
{"translation": "I even think the design of the device is nice."}
{"translation": "It was kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or be put up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after about a half year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the thermometer still appears to be intact, and it continues to display plausible values."}
{"translation": "The hygrometer, on the other hand, is finished; it displays completely astronomical values for humidity."}
{"translation": "It is a shame since the device was installed in a protected place outside which is the reason I can only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Strong mower with weak catcher attachment"}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the first delivery attempt as of today is still out driving through the republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with initiating a replacement deliver is outstanding as always."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly and made a good first impression."}
{"translation": "The motor is strong, and it leaves a nice cut pattern."}
{"translation": "The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but okay."}
{"translation": "A big issue is the catcher attachment."}
{"translation": "For one thing, only the top and bottom are made of hard plastic and in between out of fabric."}
{"translation": "If you take it off briefly when it is full, the two halves of course collapse together and some of the contents fall out."}
{"translation": "But what's worse is actually that the very practical fill level indicator already turns red when the catcher attachment is only half full."}
{"translation": "This wouldn't be so bad, if the mower didn't lose large quantities of the grass clippings from that point forward."}
{"translation": "Emptying the catcher every time it is only half full if you have a large lawn can't be the solution."}
{"translation": "That's why I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back."}
{"translation": "Conclusion: A very good mower in principle, which because of the unfortunate construction of the catcher attachment is completely unusable for me."}
{"translation": "Good device for surveillance"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device is easy to integrate through the App."}
{"translation": "The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, and can also be extended if needed."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "It displays room temperature and humidity in the app, but only one to three times a day (configurable) to protect the battery."}
{"translation": "I only gave it 4 stars for the following reasons."}
{"translation": "-The device's soft back panel, which also secures the battery compartment, only closes if you play with it."}
{"translation": "-One of the two devices is in a room with relatively thick walls."}
{"translation": "This device loses its connection to the network every week or two."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect automatically, even if it is placed in the vicinity of the router."}
{"translation": "You have to take the battery out and after a short wait, put it back in, then the device will reconnect."}
{"translation": "This should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "-The alarm tone could be a little louder."}
{"translation": "3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for personal projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I haven't been able to level the Hotbed correctly yet."}
{"translation": "The right rear lock screw is tightened completely, but the Hotbed is still too high, and the right front screw is practically falling out because it isn't tightened at all even though the Hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The rods that hold the carriage are just like the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what can be done about it, because it is it is impossible to print something this way."}
{"translation": "Regarding the assembly:"}
{"translation": "The assembly wasn't a problem, but it would be nice if they would show how the cable should be installed because you might have to reposition it multiple times, which is very exhausting."}
{"translation": "I also wrote to support, but I still haven't received a response a week later."}
{"translation": "Returning it is also no longer possible."}
{"translation": "I expected more."}
{"translation": "robust and precise I am positively surprised"}
{"translation": "My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so I needed a new one."}
{"translation": "This one made a very good impression and is just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "Two batteries are included, so you can begin using it immediately."}
{"translation": "The caliper's packaging is simple, but completely serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the caliper doesn't leave any needs unmet, and performs every necessary type of measurement."}
{"translation": "I can only give it the full amount of points and believe it will hold up at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "I would clearly recommend purchasing it and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, permanent smell"}
{"translation": "Purchased the wristband and didn't wear it for the time being because it was emitting a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "The smell still isn't gone even though it was constantly \"aired out."}
{"translation": "After a return was no longer possible, I simply got rid of it."}
{"translation": "Recommend against buying"}
{"translation": "Okay for the price"}
{"translation": "The stars and spheres on this chain are a little too big for me, so it seems quite massive."}
{"translation": "The bigger spheres move freely, which I, on the other hand, think is very nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain is very cheaply finished overall, so I have managed to rip the clasp open twice already."}
{"translation": "Up until now, I have been able to repair it, but I don't think it will not work/hold up well for long."}
{"translation": "But for the cheap price you simply cannot expect really high quality."}
{"translation": "A very pretty piece of jewelry"}
{"translation": "A wonderfully made wristband and the simple clasp actually holds!"}
{"translation": "You only have to pull the end though the mouth, it can't open, unbelievable!"}
{"translation": "I have rubbed some leather conditioner into it, which makes it somewhat softer and smoother."}
{"translation": "Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm:"}
{"translation": "The clasp is made out of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, garbage!"}
{"translation": "I was already disappointed when I opened it because the small displays on the transmitter were all scratched, so that I had the feeling that it was used merchandise."}
{"translation": "The base station was alright."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "Didn't connect until after I played around with it."}
{"translation": "if you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, the transmitter didn't finally connect until after I took the battery back out of the base station and put it back in again."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my delight over it didn't last long because the connection was gone again an hour later even though the transmitter was next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Also, the displays on the three transmitters were very different!"}
{"translation": "All in all, this is not useful for me!"}
{"translation": "This thing was returned!"}
{"translation": "Would advise against purchasing this, just causes problems!"}
{"translation": "Shipping damage"}
{"translation": "Hello, I have had this garden pump once already, unfortunately the internal threads of the shaft have rusted after 3 and a half years."}
{"translation": "That's the reason I purchased it again, I desperately needed it because of the ongoing drought, and I knew that all of the connections of the suction lines as well as the diversion would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the shaft on the previous pump was a manufacturing defect and that the current pump can do its job somewhat longer."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the new pump has shipping damage, the plastic covering was ripped, and the ventilation slit was broken."}
{"translation": "The outside of the cardboard box was also damaged, which is why I would recommend that the pump be packaged better in the future than just using a thin cardboard box."}
{"translation": "I kept the pump anyway because, as I mentioned above, I desperately needed it and the rips in the plastic cover and the pump performance won't be affected."}
{"translation": "Could have been thought through better."}
{"translation": "Since I often have to deal with various keys, I thought an organizer would be more comfortable than walking around with a huge key ring all the time."}
{"translation": "Everything went really well in the beginning."}
{"translation": "However, the finish came off really quickly and the screws had to be tightened all the time."}
{"translation": "It's nice that it can be done with a one-cent coin, but it can also only be done a one-cent coin."}
{"translation": "I couldn't find a flat screwdriver in the correct size that didn't immediately ruin the screw."}
{"translation": "And now to the most annoying thing about this: getting the keys on."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can use the various parts to set the screw at various sizes and lengths, but if you have screwed the whole things already, you need pliers to take it all apart again."}
{"translation": "Attaching the keys is quite simply a game of a patience, balance, and skill."}
{"translation": "Finally, the third time I mounted the screws, the threads of the screws broke off and the whole thing became unusable."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all, then only once you have all the keys you need and then never again, but at this price you can also purchase a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Doesn't exactly meet the prescribed measurements"}
{"translation": "Easy zippers, the material seems robust, and it is all light as a feather."}
{"translation": "Since I do not have anything to compare it to (my first organizer set), I won't really be able to assess the product until after I have actually used it the first time."}
{"translation": "For now, I can say that it is not as tall as was indicated."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything into it, such as for a three-week vacation."}
{"translation": "If need be, the really big parts can go right into the suitcase as in the past."}
{"translation": "It should also be noted that not 8 but 10 pieces were delivered, because there were two smaller pouches/bags in the round cosmetic case."}
{"translation": "Not well-made, but I still wanted to mention it."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag is a different color and is made out of a different material than the other bags doesn't really personally bother me."}
{"translation": "I consider the price-performance relationship to be a trial price and that is okay."}
{"translation": "So lala"}
{"translation": "Okay, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas, too."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Exchanged."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "I could have thrown the money directly in the garbage can."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "It is easy to use, but you should be very careful when you get near the brushes so you don't damage the needle."}
{"translation": "I couldn't hear an improvement to the sound on my high-quality record player."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Two black cables were included."}
{"translation": "The batteries last a long time."}
{"translation": "Definitely perfectly adequate sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that even after wearing the headphones for a long time, they don't hurt and are rather very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The earpieces are very soft and comfortable to wear."}
{"translation": "Even the weight is kept to a minimum."}
{"translation": "Recommend purchasing for this price range."}
{"translation": "nice dress"}
{"translation": "Very nice dress that can be worn for various occasions."}
{"translation": "It is a very good value for the money, especially since I got it during a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size;"}
{"translation": "I am happy that I did not order it in a smaller size (as was recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wish that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more material (if you don't have upper arms as thin as those of the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a nice dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Don't touch."}
{"translation": "It can't be any worse."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously didn't expect that such junk is being sold these days."}
{"translation": "The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the USB ports deliver enough electricity."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, it's impossible to run this drive without any issues."}
{"translation": "DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are at most occasionally recognized."}
{"translation": "The discs must be inserted multiple times, then they make rattling sounds that you haven't heard since old PCs and the first CD-ROM drives made them in the '90s."}
{"translation": "Minutes later you can either restart the computer because nothing works, or the disc will finally be recognized."}
{"translation": "Then you absolutely cannot press pause or jump ahead to a new chapter or change the language during a movie or anything else."}
{"translation": "This immediately causes it to freeze, and it can't be fixed."}
{"translation": "On top of that, it of course doesn't have any Blu-ray software."}
{"translation": "If you buy PowerDVD or some kind of similar subscription the operating system doubles in price."}
{"translation": "Does what it's supposed to, but it isn't pretty."}
{"translation": "First of all, I'd like to point out that both USB ports are actually a sham because the port that points upwards is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only there to charge another device and is therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I'd only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this shapeless ball with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "Apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension serves its purpose very reliably."}
{"translation": "And because of the weight of the plugs, a plugged in USB stick doesn't just dangle around as it would with a normal extension cord."}
{"translation": "So not really a bad purchase, but my excitement has its limits :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but whoa!"}
{"translation": "I purchased this product so that I my iPad (Pro) could have an audio outlet and so that I can attach a display."}
{"translation": "You can also move data back and forth with IOS 12 now."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "The audio output was also as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters which I already had to return unfortunately couldn't do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI outlet is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller per BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Volume is delivered over HDMI."}
{"translation": "What do I still use my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter that could be used to attach it to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This is supposed to create stability and also has a magnetic support."}
{"translation": "My cover does not fit with the adapter."}
{"translation": "Well, it holds securely, and it has contact so from this point."}
{"translation": "All in all, it is somewhat expensive but can be justified based on its full range of functions."}
{"translation": "At the same time, it is still very small, and everything is securely attached in a piece of aluminum."}
{"translation": "Value is there for the money."}
{"translation": "Lots of power"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Has been running for months without a problem."}
{"translation": "Isn't exactly light or quiet, but it is very effective."}
{"translation": "I think the intermediate temperature setting (Tp setting) is somewhat too cool and that is why I usually have it set to level 2."}
{"translation": "It has fallen on the tile floor multiple times, and it has survived."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competitive products like to look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good"}
{"translation": "The craftsmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, even though there is a large price difference when compared to the original, but it does not make a good impression."}
{"translation": "When used, the sense of a high-quality process was confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I really liked these brushes and I can recommend them without hesitation."}
{"translation": "Great product with weak battery"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised that tracks to within 0. 5 m in live mode."}
{"translation": "In the offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it likes to jump a few meters, which doesn't bother me."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again at any time."}
{"translation": "But it would be great is a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "It currently lasts about a day and a half."}
{"translation": "A solution for this would be great it if would last 7-14 days."}
{"translation": "While there is an XL version, it's unfortunately too big for our taste and the battery doesn't have to last that long, but we consider changing it every day to be impractical."}
{"translation": "You should be busy with your dog and not with his collar :-)."}
{"translation": "The app also works perfectly."}
{"translation": "Trash after a few weeks"}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in multiple sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and also appear to be comfortable."}
{"translation": "But they keep lasting for less time."}
{"translation": "Even though my son only wears the shoes for gym class, the soles are broken after just a few weeks and the shoes can't be used anymore."}
{"translation": "With the last pair it even happened during normal use, that they did not last very long, but I thought they would be sufficient for class."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this wasn't so."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not to be recommended."}
{"translation": "Fits perfectly but original?"}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs sadly broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones."}
{"translation": "At first glance, they were unfortunately very poorly made."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the previous ones I owned."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there is no noticeable difference, however a second look and you can see how poorly the edges are finished and the heel strap is loose, and these will probably not last five years like my previous pair did."}
{"translation": "We'll see!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Since there are not many recommendations to read here anymore, I was very skeptical at first."}
{"translation": "However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I took a chance and ordered it anyway."}
{"translation": "The entire order included a mattress and a car air pump."}
{"translation": "Regarding the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I tested it by laying it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo)."}
{"translation": "I then noticed that there was some mold on one of the sides."}
{"translation": "I cleaned it off and hope that it doesn't come back."}
{"translation": "Once inflated I performed a laying test."}
{"translation": "It's nice to lay on and it's perfect for the festival."}
{"translation": "Naturally, this mattress can't replace your normal bed mattress, but it's pure luxury for the days at event."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits perfectly in my car."}
{"translation": "Before we put it in, we took the back seats out."}
{"translation": "So, it fit perfectly."}
{"translation": "The air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has various attachments."}
{"translation": "The mattress needs two different attachments, which you can find on the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the plug was damaged (a little on the solder seam)."}
{"translation": "Since my friend mechanically inclined, he was able to repair it and the part worked really well after it was put back together and pumped the mattress up in no time."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very happy with the mattress."}
{"translation": "I am looking forward to the firmness test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it doesn't lose air and lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "Also, that the mold doesn't return."}
{"translation": "After this test I can already recommend it in any case."}
{"translation": "Should I have a different experience, I will revise my recommendation accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10 euros."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1."}
{"translation": "For the quick delivery."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea behind the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, multiple doors on the calendar ripped on the first day thanks to its shoddy manufacturing."}
{"translation": "The 21st door didn't even have a door cover any more, which meant that I must, more or less, allow my son to open all the remaining doors and take the remaining parts out since the parts pretty much just had already fallen out."}
{"translation": "The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that the car needs to be taken apart repeatedly to get all the parts in the right places."}
{"translation": "After the car is completely built parts fall off while playing."}
{"translation": "(Usually the front windshield."}
{"translation": "It is also really difficult to reinstall."}
{"translation": "For the most part, I wouldn't purchase this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"translation": "Maybe the designers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar and improve it for the next installment."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am thrilled with the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter flies it."}
{"translation": "It flies very well inside, and the 5 min."}
{"translation": "Flight time is usually enough."}
{"translation": "At this price point, I didn't expect anything less than the fact that hair can get caught in the drone and that the drone breaks very quickly, but crashes from the ceiling to the floor, it doesn't matter if it's tile or carpet, are not a problem."}
{"translation": "Contact me if you have any questions."}
{"translation": "Game okay but can only be played with pressure to Steam."}
{"translation": "When I bought it I didn't notice that it isn't a game CD, but merely a code with which you can download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be okay, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is a shame."}
{"translation": "Since then, the computer is always stopping, which surely wouldn't be the case if the game had just been installed."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately it falls short on the battery life"}
{"translation": "I was very excited about the watch."}
{"translation": "Design and optics are great, messages, etc. , are shown without a problem."}
{"translation": "Operation works well."}
{"translation": ". and nevertheless I am sending it back."}
{"translation": "The big problem: the battery and its life."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, during the night only placed on the closet and in the morning, 11% less battery when not using."}
{"translation": "When a lot of messages came during the day, the battery was already finished by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore, not useable for me."}
{"translation": "Too bad."}
{"translation": "Generous cover with limitations"}
{"translation": "You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+."}
{"translation": "Lately, I like the cases that you can carry a credit card in."}
{"translation": "This is a feature of this case."}
{"translation": "If you put credit cards in all 3 slots, it is too much, so the lid sticks up."}
{"translation": "One is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather case makes a good impression and seems to be well made."}
{"translation": "It looks expensive."}
{"translation": "In opposition to many other cases, the cell phone is completely protected and there are only gaps on the connections."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, you can easily use the on/off button and volume control through the case."}
{"translation": "A disadvantage is that charging on some QI charging stations is not possible to charge the phone through the thick case."}
{"translation": "Even the leather QI charging station made by TORRO doesn't work."}
{"translation": "Accessories like Galaxy Buds cannot be charged and can only be charged when the case is off."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, really nice well made!"}
{"translation": "high-quality cover with bulletproof film"}
{"translation": "Robust case with real bulletproof glass as a screen protector in a classic design that offers complete protection for the entire iPhone 11."}
{"translation": "Fits really well and can also be removed easily."}
{"translation": "The material is comfortable in your hand and doesn't get dirty."}
{"translation": "A really successful and nice product that is a good value for the money."}
{"translation": "This case supports the phone."}
{"translation": "It is not too bulky and fits tightly to the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall, a good purchase."}
