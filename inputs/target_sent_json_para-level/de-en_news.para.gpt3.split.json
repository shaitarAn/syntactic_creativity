{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games in me was ignited by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "It represented for me an opportunity to explore new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual."}
{"translation": "To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "I had this dull feeling that video games only exploited a tiny part of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on \"action\" and overlooked a fundamental element of human experience: emotions."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true medium for conveying emotions."}
{"translation": "Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest achievement is indeed the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not solely based on fighting repulsive monsters in dark corridors and shooting crates for ammunition but has much more demanding and profound content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that you can tell a story and offer gameplay without having to sacrifice either narrative or interactive elements as a result."}
{"translation": "I hope both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are rather skeptical about video games, I may hope that Fahrenheit helps change your attitude towards them."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talents, and ambitions."}
{"translation": "For interactivity is still in its infancy and offers us all the chance to discover everything anew."}
{"translation": "In the past two years,Fahrenheit has filled a significant part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us time and again to question many of the previously unquestionable principles."}
{"translation": "I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you also doesn't pass by without leaving a trace on you."}
{"translation": "David Cage"}
{"translation": "THE README FILE"}
{"translation": "On the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM, there is a ReadMe file where the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed."}

{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed"}
{"translation": "The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics."}
{"translation": "That's also the reason for giving it a 1 star rating."}
{"translation": "The second reason is that the correct jacket arrived without any visible stitching errors."}
{"translation": "BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was even greater."}
{"translation": "I had based my decision on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L."}
{"translation": "Since it's supposed to fit tightly and I didn't want to struggle with an S or M size due to my bust size."}
{"translation": "In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips."}
{"translation": ".. but I could swim in it everywhere else."}
{"translation": "Additionally, when opening the package, some lining material was already coming out and spreading everywhere."}
{"translation": "Simply a shame."}
{"translation": "It will be returned :/"}
{"translation": "Fast delivery and good quality workmanship"}
{"translation": "The jacket makes a great impression."}
{"translation": "We were surprised by the good quality."}
{"translation": "You can wear it well on both sides."}
{"translation": "We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally excited about it."}
{"translation": "She usually wears size 158 and the size 36 fits her quite well in this case and will likely also be worn next year."}
{"translation": "We can recommend placing an order."}
{"translation": "Robust quality"}
{"translation": "I have chosen the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack, which is not optimal."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I measured wrong and the pad doesn't fit perfectly."}
{"translation": "But that's my mistake."}
{"translation": "I then made slight adjustments so that it fits."}
{"translation": "The pad is very sturdy and no longer damages the edges."}
{"translation": "You can use the groove or the entire surface."}
{"translation": "It worked without any problems."}
{"translation": "Nothing slips anymore."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again immediately."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately too big for under 1 year."}
{"translation": "The product itself is okay, but not recommended for children under one year old."}
{"translation": "The chewing area is too large for their small mouths."}
{"translation": "We got it when our son was 7 months old, but he couldn't use it because of the size."}
{"translation": "Now at 12 months old, we found it again and he can use it."}
{"translation": "He hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his few existing teeth."}
{"translation": "And when it's been in the fridge, it calms him down a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, returning it."}
{"translation": "I've probably been blinded here by the partly exuberant reviews."}
{"translation": "I would like to add that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use."}
{"translation": "One very large (for storing equipment) and one fairly small for the most important everyday things that you just take with you."}
{"translation": "Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2. 8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement."}
{"translation": "During Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand."}
{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, disappointment followed:"}
{"translation": "The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that's true."}
{"translation": "But it cannot compete (as mentioned in many reviews) with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices."}
{"translation": ".. guys, that simply isn't true!"}
{"translation": "I really hoped it would be like that, but there's really no comparison."}
{"translation": "The padded walls are much thinner and do not provide such protection as my Lowepro does."}
{"translation": "Oh and the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro at all."}
{"translation": "Even the zippers and materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high-quality."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have decided to return this backpack."}
{"translation": "If I invest in equipment worth thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend money on a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "Quality obviously comes at a price here."}
{"translation": "For someone who doesn't want to spend much money, this backpack is definitely a good choice; however not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's also not like making this decision was difficult for me."}
{"translation": "When I unpacked the backpack, after 2 minutes knew it had to go back."}
{"translation": "What appealed to me was its color inside; you can definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different demands for a backpack, this backpack is probably great, but mine is going back."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed by the third part"}
{"translation": "So far, I had liked the Electric series by E. L."}
{"translation": "Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book."}
{"translation": "I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part."}
{"translation": "In that part, it's all about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time, and I found it unnecessarily dragged out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been crushing on Volt for so long, finally confesses everything, and then acts like a little child and withdraws every time there is an argument?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also inconsistencies in my opinion because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince his ex that Taylor couldn't live without him and that he had heard it himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped that this would be the final part of the series, but I think this part is the weakest one and also quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless,I will still read the fourth part in hopes that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring more tension back into t"}
{"translation": "Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and do not learn!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not as bad as many write."}
{"translation": "Of course, the story is completely contrived and repeatedly conceived according to the same formula."}
{"translation": "Once you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and do not learn!"}
{"translation": "And that's exactly what this movie wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "How often did I think while watching this movie (even though I know it's just a film and the animals are computer-generated):"}
{"translation": "Oh my God, those poor animals, tears often well up in my eyes."}
{"translation": "Therefore Jurassic World:"}
{"translation": "Fallen"}
{"translation": "Kingdom is really well made."}
{"translation": "It's just a pity that humans simply don't get the message behind this film, even though it's a mainstream movie."}
{"translation": "We consistently destroy animals and nature and ultimately our planet along with ourselves out of greed for money and possessions, stupidity, and arrogance!"}
{"translation": "Empathy for the environment and living beings: absent."}
{"translation": "4 stars because the film is well made but unfortunately follows the same principle every time;"}
{"translation": "otherwise it could have been 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, well-made popcorn entertainment."}
{"translation": "a quiet, sensitive film"}
{"translation": "Some expect a film like 8 Mile here."}
{"translation": "This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be one either."}
{"translation": "This film is mainly \"French\" also, it is calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and makes one cryif one engages with it and doesn't expect things from it that it doesn't want to be."}
{"translation": "Problematic"}
{"translation": "Taste like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but it doesn't matter."}
{"translation": "5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing."}
{"translation": "My waistline has grown by 12 cm!"}
{"translation": "Bloating like never before!"}
{"translation": "Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day."}
{"translation": "Not very helpful, unfortunately despite stopping immediately the diarrhea has been going on for a week now."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars were given (unfortunately seen too late), while with the larger one it received full 5 stars?"}
{"translation": "That is very very strange!"}
{"translation": "Terrible smell and poor results!"}
{"translation": "I dyed my blonde hair with an intense toner to a chocolate brown in October, and in February/March, I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I applied the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled horrible!"}
{"translation": "However, the result wasn't too bad it turned out to be a chestnut brown (slightly darker)."}
{"translation": "Since I didn't achieve my desired result, according to the instructions, I used it again when unsatisfied."}
{"translation": "This time was just a waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It made no difference my hair looked the same as in the first attempt."}
{"translation": "And worst of all, weeks after using it, it still stank."}
{"translation": "No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away."}
{"translation": "Highly recommended"}
{"translation": "I have been taking the tablets for a long period of time now, one tablet every 5 days."}
{"translation": "My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional long-term illness."}
{"translation": "I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy nutrition but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2."}
{"translation": "This is working very well."}
{"translation": "I feel more energetic and much more comfortable."}
{"translation": "I sleep better and get out of bed easier."}
{"translation": "The price is also great considering how long the tablets can be taken."}
{"translation": "Absolutely recommendable."}
{"translation": "Function not quite flawless!!!"}
{"translation": "After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying:"}
{"translation": "1) Over time, the case has problems connecting to the phone."}
{"translation": "This means that it no longer charges even though you have held down the \"Power On/Off\" button for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "Removing and reinstalling the phone in the case solves the problem in about 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect."}
{"translation": "2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the cover is now so worn out that it comes off from its own accord, which has almost caused me to lose it several times."}
{"translation": "Although these are not many major defects, I believe that a battery case should function perfectly in its function, especially considering its cost of \u20ac30, and therefore I am very disappointed with this product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months."}
{"translation": "Too expensive, too thin and disappointing."}
{"translation": "I don't know how all these good reviews come about."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, it's actually just an eyeglass cleaning cloth that you can get as a gift in slightly smaller form at any optician."}
{"translation": "The cleaning effect is just as good as a kitchen towel and no better."}
{"translation": "I expected much more from these cloths, they are also really thin."}
{"translation": "Since I used it, I can't exchange it anymore, I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side."}
{"translation": "The price for these cloths is way too high; you shouldn't pay more than 2 euros for them."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response"}
{"translation": "I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "In general, the Onforu works great, it is waterproof (it has already fallen in the shower), it reproduces bass like bass should, Bluetooth works great."}
{"translation": "Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come loose."}
{"translation": "it can play sound very loudly."}
{"translation": "yes."}
{"translation": ". what I find critical is the frequency response of this little speaker."}
{"translation": "As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are played very loudly while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt my ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough."}
{"translation": "Although my old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu and I find it somewhat annoying."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have to deduct one star for that."}
{"translation": "I expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "Some places had the paint chipped off and when you touched it with your hand, the paint came off in some places too."}
{"translation": "We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts, but how if both chests of drawers were damaged."}
{"translation": "Bad service from the manufacturer, Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money."}
{"translation": "A praise to Amazon."}
{"translation": "to spend a little more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered that have to be glued together oneself."}
{"translation": "The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no additional protection."}
{"translation": "Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, some templates were damaged."}
{"translation": "I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product."}
{"translation": "The included adhesive hardly holds but sticks well like gum that doesn't harden."}
{"translation": "Almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick just one day after gluing."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one has to be very careful not to glue everything together."}
{"translation": "The templates are partially incomplete or punched out incorrectly."}
{"translation": "For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest more money and go for a high-quality product instead."}
{"translation": "I am not dissatisfied."}
{"translation": "The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic closures + nice appearance + sturdy when assembled + adjustable shelf position"}
{"translation": "Doors slamming due to magnets (can possibly be balanced with rubber stoppers) some unclean spots"}
{"translation": "The supplied dowels are way too small and wobbly (didn't have any others and there was no trophy in the house, so I glued them down with craft glue)"}
{"translation": "The brackets for the shelf are somewhat wobbly (wrapped them with some paper and leveled it out)"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it didn't look so good and have good dimensions, I would give it fewer stars because you have to make everything fit to be truly satisfied."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, I also find it a bit too expensive for that reason."}
{"translation": "I like the coffee."}
{"translation": "but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (although also significantly more expensive)."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "Additionally, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged as seen in the photo) deducts one star for me."}
{"translation": "I hope that the manufacturer changes this and soon receives a full score."}
{"translation": "It annoys me."}
{"translation": "The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "However, the natural sounds are horrible and incredibly loud."}
{"translation": "I couldn't even turn them down."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, supposedly it's possible."}
{"translation": "Even the quietest radio setting was too loud for me, I would immediately wake up."}
{"translation": "Additionally, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can create shadows on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning."}
{"translation": "But when it finally happened and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me."}
{"translation": "I liked the colors and color changes, but unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "One good thing was that it has a battery so that in case of a power outage, you don't need to input the time again."}
{"translation": "However, it had to be returned due to the reasons mentioned above."}
{"translation": "Light great, processing insufficient."}
{"translation": "I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without sockets instead, a circuit board is smiling at me in this spot. .."}
{"translation": "There was also nothing in the box."}
{"translation": "\"Pay for 6 receive 4\" is not a good deal."}
{"translation": "Amazon would probably have handled it generously and quickly, but I only realized this after the return period had expired."}
{"translation": "So while I see it as my mistake and live with it, it's still not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs so that's the only reason for deducting two stars."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated."}
{"translation": "The color of the light tends more towards cool white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc."}
{"translation": "For living rooms, personally I would prefer warmer light."}
{"translation": "Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb indeed"}
{"translation": "Other lamps can do that too and maybe I will also get intact ones there according to my order should my review be helpful to you;"}
{"translation": "I appreciate positive ratings!"}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I received the set yesterday and I would like to share my first impressions."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive ones."}
{"translation": "I debated for a long time whether to order this set or not."}
{"translation": "**The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand."}
{"translation": "**All utensils have a hole in the handle for hanging them up."}
{"translation": "**The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots, and is particularly practical for use with coated pans."}
{"translation": "**They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 \u2109."}
{"translation": "**They also do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly."}
{"translation": "**However, sometimes the dishwasher leaves water spots on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But after a quick wipe, they're gone."}
{"translation": "In conclusion, I have to say that I am very surprised and can only recommend them"}
{"translation": "Sold as new, second-hand goods."}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping is simply great."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts."}
{"translation": "We discovered that the part had already been installed before."}
{"translation": "We had to find significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts."}
{"translation": "The connections of the hoses were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only now did we see that there are also scratch marks/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This part was probably already delivered and returned."}
{"translation": "We will keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion; we will never again order such goods through Amazon but rather spend a little more at a hardware store where we get proper quality goods."}
{"translation": "It's just sad to see customers being deceived like this!"}
{"translation": "Product itself top, unfortunately external sensor broken after 6 months."}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very easy, and the range is also very good."}
{"translation": "There are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is very simple and can be either wall-mounted or set up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, it seems that the device that measures the values outside is broken."}
{"translation": "However, the thermometer still seems to be intact as plausible values continue to be displayed here."}
{"translation": "On the other hand, it appears that the hygrometer is broken because it consistently shows completely astronomical values for outdoor air humidity."}
{"translation": "That's a shame since the device was mounted in a protected location outside and it's also why I only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Strong mower with weak grass catcher"}
{"translation": "Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still happily driving around the country with Hermes today, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression."}
{"translation": "The motor is powerful and it provides a nice cutting result."}
{"translation": "The noise level is not particularly impressive low, but okay."}
{"translation": "A major drawback, unfortunately, is the collection bag."}
{"translation": "Firstly, it is made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between."}
{"translation": "When you set it down full for just a moment, it naturally gets compressed and parts of its contents fall out."}
{"translation": "However, worse still is that the actually practical fill level indicator turns red when the bag is only half full."}
{"translation": "That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large portions of its clippings from that point onward."}
{"translation": "Emptying the bag when it's only half full cannot be considered a solution for large lawn areas."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I cleaned up the device as best I could and returned it."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "In principle, a very good mower that becomes unusable for me due to an unfortunate construction of its collection bag."}
{"translation": "Good device for monitoring."}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated via the app."}
{"translation": "The included plug-in sensor cable is very good and can be extended if necessary."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons I am only giving 4 stars:"}
{"translation": "The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is difficult to close again."}
{"translation": "One of the two devices is in a room with thick walls."}
{"translation": "This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it does not reconnect automatically even if you place it near the router."}
{"translation": "You have to remove the batteries and then reinsert them after a short pause, then it reconnects."}
{"translation": "It should actually work without removing the batteries."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm when connection is lost."}
{"translation": "The alarm tone could be a bit louder."}
{"translation": "3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I haven't been able to properly level the hotbed yet."}
{"translation": "The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw is practically falling out because it's not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what can be done about it because it's impossible to print anything like this."}
{"translation": "Regarding assembly:"}
{"translation": "The assembly was relatively problem-free; they could just show how to route the cables because otherwise you have to reroute them multiple times, which is very tiring."}
{"translation": "I have already contacted support but haven't received a response even after a week of waiting."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, returning it is no longer an option."}
{"translation": "I was expecting more than this."}
{"translation": "robust and precise I am positively surprised"}
{"translation": "My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed."}
{"translation": "This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "It comes with two batteries, so you can start right away."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the caliper is simple, but it fulfills its purpose completely."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give it full marks and believe that it will last at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "From me, there is a clear recommendation to buy, as a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent odor."}
{"translation": "Bought the bracelet and so far haven't worn it because it emits a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "Until today, this smell hasn't gone away, even though it has been constantly \"aired out\"."}
{"translation": "Since returning is no longer possible, I have disposed of it."}
{"translation": "I advise against buying it."}
{"translation": "For the price okay."}
{"translation": "The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too big for me, making it look quite bulky."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the overall processing of the chain is very simple, so I have already broken the clasp twice."}
{"translation": "So far, I have been able to repair it again every time, but I don't think that will last long."}
{"translation": "But for the cheap price, you can't expect anything really high quality anyway."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry"}
{"translation": "A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds!"}
{"translation": "You just have to pull the end through its mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I rubbed it with some leather care, making it even softer and more flexible."}
{"translation": "Just one thing:"}
{"translation": "if you have something magnetic on your arm:"}
{"translation": "The clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately garbage!"}
{"translation": "I was already disappointed after unpacking because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was fine."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "Only connects after some tinkering."}
{"translation": "if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it did the transmitters finally connect."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy about this didn't last long because after an hour, the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station."}
{"translation": "The display of the three transmitters was also very different!"}
{"translation": "All in all, not usable for me like this!"}
{"translation": "The thing has been returned!"}
{"translation": "I would definitely advise against buying it as it only brings trouble!"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Hello, I already had this garden pump once, unfortunately after 3. 5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off."}
{"translation": "I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the previous pump had a manufacturing defect with its shaft and that this current pump will last a little longer in service."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the new pump had transportation damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken."}
{"translation": "The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend better packaging for future pumps instead of just using thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, I kept the pump since as described above, I urgently needed it and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect its pumping performance."}
{"translation": "Could have been thought through better."}
{"translation": "Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought an organizer would be more convenient than carrying around a huge keyring all the time."}
{"translation": "At first, everything went well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint quickly started to come off and the screws had to be tightened constantly."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can do that with a penny coin, but only with a penny coin."}
{"translation": "I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the entire screw."}
{"translation": "Now, let's get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths with the various parts, but once you have screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it apart again."}
{"translation": "Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience and balance and dexterity."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, on my third attempt at assembling it, the screw broke in its thread and rendered the entire thing useless."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all possible, only use it once for all necessary keys and then never again; but at this price point, you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions"}
{"translation": "Smooth-running zippers, the material looks sturdy and all that in featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use."}
{"translation": "In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than stated."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I still can't really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week vacation."}
{"translation": "If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase as before."}
{"translation": "It should be noted that not 8 but 10 pieces were delivered because two smaller pouches were included in the round cosmetic bag."}
{"translation": "Not processed high quality, but wanted to mention it nonetheless."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio appears to me as a trial price and that's okay."}
{"translation": "So-so"}
{"translation": "Also, ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Replaced."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "So I could have just thrown the money into the trash can directly."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but you should approach the brush very carefully so as not to damage the needle."}
{"translation": "I couldn't hear an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Two black cables were included."}
{"translation": "The battery life lasts very long."}
{"translation": "Definitely sufficient sound quality."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also kept very low."}
{"translation": "Recommendation for purchase in this price range."}
{"translation": "chic dress"}
{"translation": "Very beautiful dress, which is suitable for a variety of occasions."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wished the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have as slim upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Hands off."}
{"translation": "It can't get any worse."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously didn't expect such garbage to be sold nowadays."}
{"translation": "The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs usually work, but Blu-rays are detected very unreliably at best."}
{"translation": "The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes noises like those you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives."}
{"translation": "After minutes, you can either restart your computer because nothing happens anymore or the disc is finally recognized."}
{"translation": "But in that case, you must absolutely not press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything at all."}
{"translation": "This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze."}
{"translation": "In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included with it."}
{"translation": "If you buy PowerDVD or something similar additionally for a fee, then this drive's price doubles."}
{"translation": "It does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually a sham, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is just for charging devices and therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I definitely wouldn't have bought this clumsy lump with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension cord fulfills its purpose very reliably."}
{"translation": "And thanks to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick doesn't just dangle around like with a normal extension cord."}
{"translation": "So not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is limited :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but powerful!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I can have an audio output and connect a display to my iPad (Pro)."}
{"translation": "With iOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to return could not do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via Bluetooth and the HDMI connected to the TV."}
{"translation": "Charging at the same time is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Sound is delivered through HDMI."}
{"translation": "What else do I need my PlayStation for? :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This should provide stability and also has magnetic mounting."}
{"translation": "It doesn't fit with my case, but it holds securely anyway and has contact, so. .."}
{"translation": "All in all, it's somewhat expensive but justified by its full range of functions."}
{"translation": "It's also very small and made of solid aluminum in one piece."}
{"translation": "Price-performance ratio is great"}
{"translation": "Lots of power"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Has been running smoothly for months."}
{"translation": "It's not exactly lightweight or quiet but it delivers good performance."}
{"translation": "I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) rather cool and therefore I always use level 2."}
{"translation": "It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competing products often look like spaceships"}
{"translation": "Very good."}
{"translation": "The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, even though the price difference compared to the original is very big, but does not give a cheap impression."}
{"translation": "In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great product with weak battery"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised."}
{"translation": "In live mode, the tracking is accurate to about 0. 5 meters."}
{"translation": "In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not bothersome."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again anytime."}
{"translation": "However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer."}
{"translation": "Currently, it lasts about 1. 5 days."}
{"translation": "A solution that could last 7-14 days would be ideal."}
{"translation": "There is an XL version available but unfortunately it is too big for our taste; we wouldn't need the battery to last that long anyway and changing it daily is impractical in our opinion."}
{"translation": "One should engage with the dog, not with its collar :-)"}
{"translation": "The app also worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks, garbage."}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and also seem to be comfortable."}
{"translation": "However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more."}
{"translation": "Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole already breaks after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore."}
{"translation": "With the last pair, it was also the case that they didn't last very long in regular use, but I thought it would be enough for class."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "Fits perfectly but original?"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones."}
{"translation": "These ones, however, seem poorly made at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel sits quite loosely and will most likely not hold up for five years like my previous ones did."}
{"translation": "I'm curious!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good."}
{"translation": "Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical."}
{"translation": "However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I decided to take a chance and ordered it."}
{"translation": "The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump."}
{"translation": "About the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I tried it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo)."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there was some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it off and hope it doesn't reappear."}
{"translation": "Once inflated, a test lying down was immediately conducted."}
{"translation": "It's comfortable to lie on and perfect for the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but for days at the event it's pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits perfectly in my car."}
{"translation": "We removed the rear seats beforehand, so it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "About the air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has various adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters which can be found on the pump itself."}
{"translation": "nevertheless,the plug was defective (a problem with the solder joint)."}
{"translation": "Since my friend is skilled at handiwork, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, that good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time at all."}
{"translation": "I'm very impressed with the mattress overall."}
{"translation": "I'm curious about how well it will hold up during the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it doesn't lose any air and lasts long."}
{"translation": "And also that mold doesn't reappear."}
{"translation": "After testing,I can definitely recommend it."}
{"translation": "For future experiences,I will revise this review accordingly(if possible)."}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars. :( 1."}
{"translation": "For the fast shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open on several doors already on day 1 due to poor processing."}
{"translation": "There were no doors left on door number 21 and I had to allow my son to remove the remaining parts because they were practically falling out already."}
{"translation": "The pieces often come out mixed up, which means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach them properly."}
{"translation": "After assembling the car completely, parts fall off during play (especially the windshield)."}
{"translation": "It is also very difficult to reattach it."}
{"translation": "Overall, I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either."}
{"translation": "Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider how they design the calendar for future editions and make improvements."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am enthusiastic about the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter flies it."}
{"translation": "Indoors, it flies very well and the 5-minute flight time is usually sufficient."}
{"translation": "I didn't expect anything different at this price that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem."}
{"translation": "Nice contact for any questions."}
{"translation": "Game okay but only playable with mandatory Steam."}
{"translation": "Didn't realize when purchasing that it's not a game CD but just a code to download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be fine so far, but one is forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which wouldn't happen with a simple installation of the game for sure."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime."}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the watch."}
{"translation": "Design and appearance are great, messages etc."}
{"translation": "Were displayed without any problems."}
{"translation": "Operation worked well."}
{"translation": ". and yet I'm sending it back."}
{"translation": "The big drawback: the battery and its runtime."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, just lying on the shelf overnight, and in the morning 11% less battery with no usage."}
{"translation": "If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery would already be empty by noon / early afternoon, and then you can't even tell the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore not usable for me."}
{"translation": "Very unfortunate."}
{"translation": "Noble case with restrictions"}
{"translation": "For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it is definitely advisable to get a case."}
{"translation": "Recently, I have liked cases into which you can also insert your credit card."}
{"translation": "This case here offers that."}
{"translation": "If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much and the cover stands a bit high."}
{"translation": "One is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well-made."}
{"translation": "It looks classy."}
{"translation": "Unlike many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, with only cutouts at the connectors."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, you can easily operate the power button and volume controls on the sides through the cover."}
{"translation": "The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case."}
{"translation": "Even on TORRO's leather QI charging station, it doesn't work either."}
{"translation": "Accessories like Galaxy Buds can only be charged when the case is off as well."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, really chic and well-made!"}
{"translation": "high-quality case with tempered glass film"}
{"translation": "Robust case with a genuine tempered glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11."}
{"translation": "Fits very well and can be easily put on."}
{"translation": "The material is pleasant to hold and does not get dirty."}
{"translation": "A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio."}
{"translation": "This case gives the phone some grip."}
{"translation": "It is not too bulky and fits securely on the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall, a good purchase."}
