{"translation": "The endless sea roar did not subside for a minute."}
{"translation": "It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding."}
{"translation": "And the wind began to rustle in the bare trees, then fell silent, just like I did, listening to the flow of the night."}
{"translation": "But it didn't go away, it was here."}
{"translation": "I knew it by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf."}
{"translation": "I had noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed like a small living creature, my only awake friend."}
{"translation": "Occasionally, gunshots echoed from the darkness, from the city, followed by the prolonged barking of dogs."}
{"translation": "Then, far out at sea, a faint light flickered and went out."}
{"translation": "He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover in them many previously unnoticed qualities."}
{"translation": "In the yellow, noseless stone, there were many small, tightly embedded sea shells, while on the branches of the drooping bushes, there were still a few faded colors, like damp, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun."}
{"translation": "But it rarely emerged from the fog as a faint white blotch, providing neither warmth nor shade."}
{"translation": "Under the single old plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, the leaves lay like cut-out pieces of dull green velvet."}
{"translation": "Along the cast-iron gutter,a procession of ants carried their last supplies for the winter,while near the anchor chain,a small timid frog lived."}
{"translation": "Someone on the other side of the river started flashing a light and shouting loudly at night."}
{"translation": "I went out with my uncle Ilko to the riverbank."}
{"translation": "The river was roaring."}
{"translation": "The water was flowing through the dam as a cold waterfall."}
{"translation": "It was a late, silent night, not a single star was visible above."}
{"translation": "The wind was blowing fiercely, carrying the freshness of thawed earth."}
{"translation": "And all the time, someone on the other side was flashing a light and shouting, but the words were inaudible over the river's noise."}
{"translation": "When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black my mother."}
{"translation": "She was standing motionless on the bank."}
{"translation": "She saw from there how they were carrying my father."}
{"translation": "Then she knelt down and fell face down onto the sand."}
{"translation": "No, replied grandfather."}
{"translation": "It's true, we haven't seen each other."}
{"translation": "Ostap began to get blind."}
{"translation": "He thought he would go to Petersburg to see that woman before he went completely blind."}
{"translation": "He reached the capital and found out that she had died, maybe she couldn't bear the separation."}
{"translation": "Ostap found her grave made of white marble on the cemetery, looked at it, and his heart burst his iron rose was lying on the stone."}
{"translation": "That woman had left a will to place a rose on her grave forever."}
{"translation": "And Ostap started to wander and, maybe, died on the road or in the market under a cart."}
{"translation": "Amen!"}
{"translation": "On the opposite bank, the preserved forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope."}
{"translation": "The sun was unable to penetrate the dense foliage of this forest."}
{"translation": "Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light slice through the canopy, revealing before us the stunning power of vegetation."}
{"translation": "Like sparkling dust particles, small birds flitted into this ray, chirping as they chased each other and dived into the leaves, as if into a green sea."}
{"translation": "I scooped water from the pond into a bucket, threw in some grass, and waited."}
{"translation": "The red poppies stood motionless in the water."}
{"translation": "Suddenly, one of them started trembling, making small circles, quickly diving or swimming away."}
{"translation": "My father cast his line, the fishing rod bent into an arc, and in the mist above the pond, a mysterious commotion began."}
{"translation": "The water churned, the cups of the water-measuring beetles hastily scattered in all directions, and finally, a golden glimmer appeared in the depths."}
{"translation": "It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp on a tangled line."}
{"translation": "It lay on its side, panting and moving its fins."}
{"translation": "From its scales came an amazing smell of \"the underwater kingdom\"."}
{"translation": "Yasha thought to himself for a few seconds."}
{"translation": "We knew that it took seven minutes to walk from Sturdzo Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium."}
{"translation": "Inside the sanatorium, behind the high fence and iron gates, we always felt completely safe."}
{"translation": "Especially if we didn't light any cigarettes."}
{"translation": "When we passed by the entrance, Yasha stumbled."}
{"translation": "Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzo Street, Yasha claimed that he always did his best to make a mess of things."}
{"translation": "I thought to myself that Yasha's annoying gait was to blame for everything."}
{"translation": "But I kept quiet so as not to upset him."}
{"translation": "We were creeping through the alley."}
{"translation": "I said that we needed to walk on the side where the archway is, stop just before reaching it, listen closely, and then quickly and silently dash past the archway."}
{"translation": "The plan, in my opinion, was mathematically precise."}
{"translation": "If there are people in the archway, they might not even notice us."}
{"translation": "However, if we were to walk on the opposite side from the archway, we may be spotted from a distance."}
{"translation": "I calculated that in this latter case we would be walking towards this dangerous archway or simply being visible to whoever might have hidden in it five times longer."}
{"translation": "And therefore there will be five times as many chances for us to get noticed."}
{"translation": "In the morning, I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls."}
{"translation": "Red and yellow marigolds swayed in the breeze outside the open window, accompanied by the scent of nasturtium; a furry bee was also peeking into the room."}
{"translation": "I watched, mesmerized, as it angrily buzzed and struggled to escape from the tight flower."}
{"translation": "Sunlit streams flowed endlessly across the ceiling, light waves reflecting the river's murmur."}
{"translation": "The river was right nearby, its gentle rumble echoing through the air."}
