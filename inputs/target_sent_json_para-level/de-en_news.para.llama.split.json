{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a wealth of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, allowing me to push the boundaries of the world."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still-developing technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still so much to discover especially a new language that was both narrative and visual."}
{"translation": "To be honest, the next ten years didn't satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "I had the nagging feeling that video games were only utilizing a tiny part of their incredible creative potential because they were too focused on \"action\" and forgot a fundamental aspect of human experience: emotions."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, technology continued to advance at a rapid pace."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that can convey emotions."}
{"translation": "Even if it could have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest achievement is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that one can create an interactive experience that is not based solely on fighting monsters in dark corridors and searching for ammunition on crates, but rather offers more complex and deeper content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer gameplay without sacrificing either narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will change your mind."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel inspired to follow this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent, and ambition."}
{"translation": "The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers."}
{"translation": "THE README FILE"}
{"translation": "On the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM, you will find a ReadMe file that contains the licensing agreement and updated information about the game."}
{"translation": "We recommend that you take a look at this file so that you can familiarize yourself with the changes that were made after the printing of this manual."}
{"translation": "To view the file, double-click on it in the Fahrenheit directory on your hard drive (usually C:\\Programme\\Atari\\Fahrenheit)."}

{"translation": "Taylor has been swooning over Volt for so long, finally admits everything, and then acts like a child during every argument and gets upset?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt had tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would stand by him and tried to convince him that Taylor couldn't do without him and he had heard it himself."}

{"translation": "Good surveillance equipment"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated via the app."}
{"translation": "The included detachable sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "The room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once or thrice a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery."}
{"translation": "For these reasons, I'll give it 4 stars."}
{"translation": "The soft back panel of the device, which also covers the battery compartment, can only be closed fiddly."}
{"translation": "One of the two devices is in a room with thick walls."}
{"translation": "This device loses its network connection every 1-2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it doesn't reconnect automatically even when placed near the router."}
{"translation": "One has to remove the batteries, wait for a short while, and then reinsert them for it to reconnect."}
{"translation": "It should be able to reconnect without removing the batteries."}
{"translation": "There's always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "The alarm tone could be a bit louder."}
{"translation": "Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer to use for my own projects, but unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed properly."}
{"translation": "The rear right fixing screw is completely tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high and the screw falls out easily, even though it's not tightened at all."}
{"translation": "The rods that hold the carriage are straight and the table is also level."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what to do about this, because it's impossible to print anything like this."}
{"translation": "The assembly was relatively problem-free, but it would be helpful to show how to route the cables properly to avoid having to reconnect them multiple times, which is very tedious."}
{"translation": "I have already contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, returning the printer is no longer an option."}
{"translation": "I had expected more."}
{"translation": "Robust and precise, I am positively surprised."}
{"translation": "My old measuring tape has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one."}
{"translation": "This one here makes a very robust impression and has proven to be just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "It comes with two batteries, so it's ready to use right out of the box."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the measuring tape is simple but fully serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "The measuring tape itself leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give it top marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old one."}
{"translation": "I highly recommend it and think a good measuring tape belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell."}
{"translation": "I bought the armband and didn't wear it for a while because it emitted a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "Despite being aired out constantly, the smell has not gone away."}
{"translation": "Since returning it was no longer an option, I disposed of it."}
{"translation": "I would advise against purchasing it."}
{"translation": "Okay for the price."}
{"translation": "The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too large for my taste, so it looks quite bulky."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain itself is very simply made, so I've managed to open the clasp twice already."}
{"translation": "I've been able to repair it each time, but I don't think that will last long."}
{"translation": "Given the low price, you can't really expect anything of high quality."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry."}
{"translation": "A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually works!"}
{"translation": "You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I've rubbed it with some leather conditioner, which makes it softer and more supple."}
{"translation": "However: anyone with a magnetic field near their arm: the clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, junk!"}
{"translation": "I was already disappointed after unpacking, since the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was fine."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "Connects only after some fidgeting."}
{"translation": "if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it back did the transmitters finally connect."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long because after an hour the connection was lost again, even though transmitters were right next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Moreover, readings from three transmitters varied greatly!"}
{"translation": "In conclusion, this device is unusable for me!"}
{"translation": "It went back right away!"}
{"translation": "I would definitely advise against purchasing this product as it will only cause trouble!"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft had rusted after 3. 5 years."}
{"translation": "I only bought it again because I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction hose and the discharge would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production defect and the new pump will last longer."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the new pump had a shipping damage, the plastic housing was torn and the air vents were broken."}
{"translation": "The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in its future use, not just using a thin cardboard box."}
{"translation": "I still kept them because as mentioned above that they were urgent loan requirements and for some reason even with cracks in its plastic housing did not impair pumping performance."}
{"translation": "\"I should have thought it through better."}
{"translation": "Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought an organizer would be more convenient than walking around with a huge key ring."}
{"translation": "At first, everything went well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint quickly wore off and the screws had to be tightened constantly."}
{"translation": "It's nice that it can also be opened with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin."}
{"translation": "I couldn't find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw."}
{"translation": "Now, the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can adjust the screws to different sizes and lengths, but you need pliers to take it apart again after it's been screwed together."}
{"translation": "Attaching the keys is simply a game of patience, balance, and dexterity."}
{"translation": "Finally, on the third attempt, the screw broke off in the thread and the whole thing became unusable."}
{"translation": "Verdict: If you really need to carry a lot of keys, it's better to buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Do not quite match the specified dimensions."}
{"translation": "Easy-to-use zippers, the material feels robust, and everything is lightweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (this is my first set of organizers), I'll only be able to truly evaluate the product after its first use."}
{"translation": "However, I can already say that the height is lower than advertised."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't quite imagine fitting everything for a three-week trip in there."}
{"translation": "The really big items will have to go directly into the suitcase just like before."}
{"translation": "It's worth noting that 10 parts were delivered instead of 8, as there were two small pouches/bags included in the round cosmetics bag."}
{"translation": "The cosmetics bag has a different color and material than the other bags, but that doesn't bother me personally."}
{"translation": "I consider the price-performance ratio to be acceptable, and that's okay."}
{"translation": "<<WRONG STATEMENT, TRANSLATION FOUND:"}
{"translation": "\"So lala\" translates to \"So silly\" or \"So foolish\" in English. >>"}
{"translation": "\"I had ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Replaced."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "I could have just thrown the money directly into the trash."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but one should be very careful when approaching the brush to not damage the needle."}
{"translation": "I could not discern any improvement in sound from my very high quality record player."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Two black cables were included."}
{"translation": "The battery life is plenty long."}
{"translation": "Definitely completely satisfactory sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones do not hurt after long wear and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cushions are totally soft and pleasant to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also very low."}
{"translation": "Recommendation to buy in this price range."}
{"translation": "Chic dress"}
{"translation": "Very nice dress that is versatile for various occasions."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is spot on, especially since I got it on a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits me perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it a size smaller (as recommended)."}
{"translation": "I would have liked the neckline to be slightly higher and the sleeves to have a bit more fabric (if you don't have as slender upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But overall, a stylish dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "\"Hands off."}
{"translation": "It doesn't get any worse than this."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously did not expect that such junk would be sold these days."}
{"translation": "The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It is assumed that the USB ports provide enough power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs work normally, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at best."}
{"translation": "The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which they make grinding noises like those heard from old PCs and the first CD-ROM drives from the 90s."}
{"translation": "After a few minutes, the computer can either be restarted because it freezes or the disc is finally recognized."}
{"translation": "But you can't press pause, skip to a chapter, change the language, or do anything else during the movie."}
{"translation": "That immediately leads to an unfixable freeze."}
{"translation": "Additionally, there is no Blu-ray software included."}
{"translation": "If you purchase PowerDVD or similar software separately, the price of this drive doubles."}
{"translation": "\"It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not very pretty."}
{"translation": "First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually just for show, since only the port that faces upwards is a real USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only there for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and would have been better off with a simple extension cord, rather than this bulky, gold-plated thing."}
{"translation": "But aside from its appearance and my misjudgment, the extension cord does its job very reliably."}
{"translation": "And thanks to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't dangle around easily, like it would with a normal extension cord."}
{"translation": "So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is limited."}
{"translation": "\"Small but oh!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display."}
{"translation": "With iOS 12, you can now transfer data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "The audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters that I had to return unfortunately couldn't do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected wirelessly to the tablet and the HDMI to the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is no problem."}
{"translation": "The sound is delivered through HDMI."}
{"translation": "What do I still need my PlayStation for? \ud83d\ude05"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "It provides stability and has a magnetic holder."}
{"translation": "However, it doesn't fit with my case and the adapter."}
{"translation": "Oh well, it still holds securely and has contact."}
{"translation": "All in all, it's a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "Plus, it's very small and made of aluminum, which makes it stable."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is appropriate."}
{"translation": "A lot of performance."}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "Has been running without problems for months."}
{"translation": "It's not particularly light or quiet, but it delivers decent performance."}
{"translation": "I find the medium temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2."}
{"translation": "It has already fallen onto the floor several times and has survived well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competitor products often look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good."}
{"translation": "The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, despite the large price difference compared to the original, which does not make a cheap impression."}
{"translation": "In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can recommend them without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great product with weak battery"}
{"translation": "We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised by its accuracy in real-time mode, which feels like 0. 5 meters."}
{"translation": "However, when the dog is indoors, it sometimes jumps a few meters, which is not disturbing."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again anytime."}
{"translation": "What would be great, though, is a battery that lasts longer."}
{"translation": "Currently, it lasts for about 1. 5 days, and a solution that could last 7-14 days would be super."}
{"translation": "There is an XL version available, but unfortunately, it's too big for our taste, and we wouldn't want to have to change the battery every day."}
{"translation": "We want to spend time with our dog, not with its collar."}
{"translation": "The app worked perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks, trash."}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and seem comfortable."}
{"translation": "However, their lifespan is decreasing significantly."}
{"translation": "Even though my son only wears them for gym class, the soles are already worn out after just a few weeks, and the shoes cannot be used anymore."}
{"translation": "The same thing happened with the previous pair, even though I thought they would last longer under normal use."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, that was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "Fits perfectly but original?"}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs finally broke after five years, so I was delighted to order a new pair."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, these ones seem poorly made at first glance."}
{"translation": "They're just as comfortable as my previous pair, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel is loose and unlikely to last five years like my previous pair."}
{"translation": "I'm curious to see how they'll hold up!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Here's the translation of the text from German to English:I was initially skeptical since there were hardly any reviews available."}
{"translation": "However, since I'm attending a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I decided to give it a try."}
{"translation": "The package included a mattress and a portable air pump."}
{"translation": "Regarding the mattress, I laid it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it off and hope it doesn't come back."}
{"translation": "Once inflated, I conducted a lying test and it was very comfortable."}
{"translation": "It's not a replacement for my own bed, but it's pure luxury for a few days at the festival."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits perfectly in my car, especially after removing the rear seats."}
{"translation": "The air pump has multiple adapters, and the mattress requires two different ones, which are also included."}
{"translation": "The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter, but the connector was defective (something wrong with welding)."}
{"translation": "Luckily, my friend is handy and was able to repair it; after that worked excellently inflating the mattress in no time."}
{"translation": "Overall, I'm very pleased with this product!"}
{"translation": "Awaiting eagerly for its durability test at festival hoping that It won't leak air over time & last longer & moreover does not have mold regrowth ."}
{"translation": "Based on initial experience can definitely recommend same"}
{"translation": "If there happen to be an update(alternative learning) during use would definitely make sure Update review(if acceptable)."}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars."}
{"translation": "1. For the quick shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open on day one, directly through several doors."}
{"translation": "On the 21st door, there were no doors left, and I had to allow my son to remove the remaining parts since they were already falling out."}
{"translation": "The parts often come loose during play, which means you have to disassemble the car again to put them back on."}
{"translation": "After the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play (the front windshield is the most common one to fall off)."}
{"translation": "I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"translation": "Maybe manufacturers will reconsider how they design their next edition's calendar and make it better :\\."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am thrilled with the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter flies it."}
{"translation": "It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually enough."}
{"translation": "I didn't expect anything else at this price, but hair getting tangled in it and the drone breaking quickly didn't surprise me."}
{"translation": "Crashes from the ceiling to the ground, whether on tiles or carpet, are no problem."}
{"translation": "Friendly contact for questions."}
{"translation": "\"Game okay but only playable with forced Steam connection."}
{"translation": "I didn't realize when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD but just a code to download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be fine, but you're forced to install Steam just to play it, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Since then, my computer has been constantly crashing, which wouldn't be the case with a clean installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life."}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the watch."}
{"translation": "The design and appearance were great, and the notifications worked flawlessly."}
{"translation": "The user interface was also good."}
{"translation": ".. but I'm still returning it."}
{"translation": "The big drawbacks: the battery and its runtime."}
{"translation": "Fully charged in the evening, left on the dresser overnight, and in the morning, there were 11% fewer battery bars without any usage."}
{"translation": "If I received a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already dead by midday or early afternoon, and I couldn't even read the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore, it's not usable for me."}
{"translation": "Very disappointing."}
{"translation": "Noble shell with limitations"}
{"translation": "For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it's definitely worth getting a case."}
{"translation": "I've recently come across cases that allow you to store your credit card, and this one has three card slots."}
{"translation": "However, if you fill all three slots, the lid will be a bit bulky."}
{"translation": "One card is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather case makes a robust impression and seems well-made."}
{"translation": "It looks elegant."}
{"translation": "The phone is embedded in the case all around, except for the connections, which have cutouts."}
{"translation": "The volume controls and power button can be easily operated through the case."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's not possible to charge the phone wirelessly on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case."}
{"translation": "Even the leather QI charging station from TORRO doesn't work."}
{"translation": "Therefore, you can only charge accessories like the Galaxy Buds when the case is removed."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, it's a stylish and well-made case!"}
{"translation": "High-quality case with armor glass film."}
{"translation": "Robust case with a genuine armored glass screen protector provides all-around protection for the iPhone 11 in a classic design."}
{"translation": "Fits well and can be easily put on."}
{"translation": "The material is pleasant to the touch and doesn't get dirty."}
{"translation": "A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio."}
{"translation": "This case gives the phone a good grip."}
{"translation": "It's not too bulky and stays firmly attached to the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall, a good purchase."}
