{"translation": "\"Let's follow this sound."}
{"translation": "It's water running,\" the priest decided."}
{"translation": "Before long the priest relaxes into the rocking chair, stretching out his legs and letting his eyes wander over the sea of fog."}

{"translation": "Among them march briskly the peddlers with all kinds of merchandise their stalls, cleverly folded now, can be carried on their backs like a knapsack, and in a moment they'll become tables full of colorful fabrics, wooden toys, eggs bought from the villages at a quarter of the price. ."}
{"translation": "The peasants also bring goats and cows for sale the animals, terrified by the commotion, stumble in the puddles."}
{"translation": "A rickety cart covered with a tattered tarp passes them, full of noisy Jews who come to the Rohatyna market from all around, and behind it struggles a luxurious carriage, which in the fog and the throng on the road is hard to keep dignified its bright lacquered doors are black with mud, and the face of the coachman in the blue cloak looks dazed, he hadn't expected such a commotion and now he's desperately searching for an opportunity to get off this devilish road."}
