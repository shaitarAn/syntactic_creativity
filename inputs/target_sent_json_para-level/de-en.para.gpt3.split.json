{"translation": "\"Be quiet,\" the optician said again, louder this time, and he walked faster."}
{"translation": "\"Selma rarely finds anything threatening or unsightly."}
{"translation": "He was completely right, and unfortunately he had said more than he should have answered to the voices."}
{"translation": "But maybe love would find her unsightly, the voices hissed."}
{"translation": "There must be a reason, they said, why the truth had been hidden for so long."}
{"translation": "\"That was cowardice,\" the optician said, shifting the leather bag to his other hip, because the jostling of the bag and the jostling of the voices was beginning to hurt."}
{"translation": "\"That was prudence,\" the voices said."}
{"translation": "\"Fear can sometimes be a good advisor,\" they said, and they hummed the theme song of the evening show."}
{"translation": "The optician was now walking slower."}
{"translation": "The path to Selma's house, which usually took ten minutes, suddenly seemed to him like a day's journey, a day's journey with a lot, a lot of baggage."}
{"translation": "That was true."}
{"translation": "The dog was snow-muddy-colored, he was washed-out grey and shaggy like an exclusive Irish Wolfhound without anything else mixed in."}
{"translation": "His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear's claws, and we all knew what that meant."}
{"translation": "Selma was still standing tall in front of the kitchen bench."}
{"translation": "She looked at the dog for a long time."}
{"translation": "Then she looked at my father as if he was a gift shop."}
{"translation": "Bauer H\u00e4ubel was firmly convinced that death would be polite, just as he himself had been his whole life."}
{"translation": "He was sure that death would not snatch his life away, but take it gently from his hand."}
{"translation": "He imagined death knocking carefully, opening the door only a crack and asking, \"May I?\" which Bauer H\u00e4ubel would naturally answer in the affirmative."}
{"translation": "\"Of course,\" Bauer H\u00e4ubel would say, \"please come in,\" and death would enter."}
{"translation": "He would stand by Bauer H\u00e4ubel's bed and ask, \"Is this a good time for you? I can come back at a later time."}
{"translation": "Bauer H\u00e4ubel would sit up and say, \"No, no, this is a very good time."}
{"translation": "Let's not put it off again, who knows when you can arrange it again,\" and death would sit in the chair prepared at the head of the bed."}
{"translation": "He would apologize in advance for the coldness of his hands, which Bauer H\u00e4ubel knew would not bother him at all, and then place a hand on Bauer H\u00e4ubel's eyes."}
{"translation": "The people in the village were uneasy; it was visible, even though most of them tried to show nothing."}
{"translation": "This morning, only a few hours after Selma's dream, the people in the village moved as if lightning had frozen on all paths, not only outside but also in the houses, lightning in the kitchens and living rooms."}
{"translation": "They moved as if their own bodies were completely foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly flammable."}
{"translation": "All day long they suspected their own lives and, as far as possible, that of others."}
{"translation": "Again and again they looked back to check if someone would jump at them with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing more to lose, and they quickly looked forward again because someone without a mind could also attack head-on."}
{"translation": "They looked up to exclude falling roof tiles, branches or heavy lampshades."}
{"translation": "They avoided all animals, because they believed that something could break out of them faster than out of humans."}
{"translation": "They made a detour around the gentle cows that might pee today, they avoided the dogs, even the very old ones that could hardly stand anymore, but who might still go for their throats today."}
{"translation": "On such days, anything was possible, it was not much more absurd than an okapi for an old dachshund to bite through one's throat."}
{"translation": "Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, most people in the village were not superstitious."}
{"translation": "They did all the things that superstition forbids: they sat calmly under wall clocks, even though superstition says that it can kill you; they slept with their heads towards the door, even though superstition says that it means you will be carried out of the door feet first; they hung out laundry between Christmas and New Year, which, as Elsbeth warned, was akin to suicide or aiding and abetting murder according to superstition."}
{"translation": "They were not scared when the screech owl called at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled with its head down at night."}
{"translation": "The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops in between."}
{"translation": "Since our first train ride, we had always played the same game: we stood with our backs to the windows, facing the opposite train doors, Martin closed his eyes, and I looked out of the window of the door that Martin had behind him."}
{"translation": "In first class, I had listed off to Martin what I saw during the ride, and Martin tried to memorize it all."}
{"translation": "That worked very well, so that in the second year of school I no longer listed anything and Martin, with his back to the window and his eyes closed, could almost recite everything I saw through the fogged-up train window: \"Wire factory,\" he said, just as we passed the wire factory."}
{"translation": "\"Now a field."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Hassel's crazy farm."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Hunting stand one."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Tire factory."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Hunting stand two."}
{"translation": "Wooded area."}
{"translation": "Farm."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Forest."}
{"translation": "Hunting stand three."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "\"What else could it have been,\" Selma said, adding that it would be hard to confuse an okapi with any other animal."}
{"translation": "\"But,\" I said, \"it could also have been a deformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the rust-red color, you couldn't really make out all that in the night, everything was so blurry."}
{"translation": "\"That's nonsense,\" Selma said, rubbing her forehead."}
{"translation": "\"Unfortunately, it's nonsense, Luise."}
{"translation": "She put a slice of cheese on the bread, folded it in half, and put it in my sandwich box."}
{"translation": "\"Do you know exactly when you dreamed this?\""}
{"translation": "\"Around three o'clock,\" Selma said."}
{"translation": "She had woken up with a start after the image of the okapi had faded away, sitting upright in bed, staring at her nightgown in which she had just been standing on the Uhlheck in her dream, and then at the alarm clock."}
{"translation": "Three o'clock."}
{"translation": "\"We probably shouldn't take this too seriously,\" Selma said, but she said it like a TV detective who doesn't take an anonymous letter too seriously."}
{"translation": "\"What is it?\""}
{"translation": "I asked."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma trilled, opening the refrigerator and taking out a package of sliced cheese and a liver sausage, which she waved around in the air."}
{"translation": "\"What would you like on your school sandwich today?\" she trilled again."}
{"translation": "\"M\u00e4uselchen,\" she trilled once more, and the trilling and M\u00e4uselchen were really alarming."}
{"translation": "\"Cheese, please,\" I said."}
{"translation": "\"What's wrong with you?\""}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma trilled."}
{"translation": "\"I already said that."}
{"translation": "She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she was still floundering, she nudged the cheese off the counter with her wrist."}
{"translation": "Selma now stood still and looked down at the cheese package as if it were something precious that had broken into a thousand pieces."}
{"translation": "Selma had dreamed of an okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, so we were convinced that the dream of an okapi and death were inextricably linked."}
{"translation": "That's how our minds work."}
{"translation": "In the blink of an eye, they can make the most disparate things belong together."}
{"translation": "Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and fir trees."}
{"translation": "When I slept downstairs with Selma, she would tell me bedtime stories with happy endings."}
{"translation": "When I was younger, I would always hold her wrist, place my thumb on her pulse and imagine that the entire world did everything in the rhythm of Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "I imagined the optician grinding lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth trimming her hedge, the grocer stocking juice bags, my mother stacking pine branches, my father stamping prescriptions, and all of them doing it exactly in Selma's heart rhythm."}
{"translation": "That always reliably put me to sleep, but now, at ten years old, Selma thought I was too old for it."}
