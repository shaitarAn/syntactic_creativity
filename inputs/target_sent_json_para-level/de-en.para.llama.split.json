{"translation": "\"Keep your mouth shut,\" the optician said again, louder this time, and walked faster."}
{"translation": "\"Selma only finds things threatening or unattractive on rare occasions."}
{"translation": "He was right, and he had unfortunately said more than he should have."}
{"translation": "But the love she might find it unattractive, the voices whispered, there must be a reason why the truth was hidden for so long."}
{"translation": "\"Cowardice was it,\" the optician said, shifting his leather bag to the other hip because the rustling of the bag and the rustling of the voices were starting to hurt."}
{"translation": "\"Prudence was it,\"  the voices said,  \"fear can be a good advisor sometimes,\" they said , humming theme tune of evening series ."}
{"translation": "The optician slowed down now , ten minute walk to Selma's house suddenly felt like day long journey with very heavy luggage ."}
{"translation": "That was correct."}
{"translation": "The dog was smoky-gray, he was washed-out gray and shaggy like an exclusive Irish Wolfhound without anything else in him."}
{"translation": "His body was still small, but his paws were huge like bear paws, and we all knew what that meant."}
{"translation": "Selma was still standing upright in front of the kitchen counter."}
{"translation": "She looked long at the dog."}
{"translation": "Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift shop."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel was convinced that death would be polite, just like he had been throughout his life."}
{"translation": "He was sure that death wouldn't snatch life away from him, but rather take it gently from his hand."}
{"translation": "He pictured death knocking softly, opening the door only a crack, and asking, \"May I come in?\""}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel would naturally answer, \"Of course,\" and death would enter."}
{"translation": "He would stand by Farmer H\u00e4ubel's bed and ask, \"Is this a good time for you? I can come back at a later time if needed."}
{"translation": "Farmer H\u00e4ubel would sit up and say, \"No, no, it's perfect right now,\" and death would sit down on the chair that had been prepared for him at the head of the bed."}
{"translation": "He would apologize for the coldness of his hands, which wouldn't bother Farmer H\u00e4ubel at all, and then place a hand on Farmer H\u00e4ubel's eyes."}
{"translation": "The villagers were uneasy, it was plain to see, even though they mostly tried to hide it."}
{"translation": "This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved about as if lightning had formed on every path, not just outside, but also inside the houses, lightning in the kitchens and living rooms."}
{"translation": "They moved as if their own bodies were foreign to them, as if all their joints were inflamed, and even the objects they handled were highly flammable."}
{"translation": "All day long, they begrudged their own lives and, as much as possible, those of others."}
{"translation": "They kept looking behind them to check if someone was creeping up with murderous intent, someone who had lost their mind and therefore had nothing left to lose, and they quickly looked away again because such a person could attack them head-on."}
{"translation": "They looked up to rule out falling roof tiles branches or heavy lampshades."}
{"translation": "They avoided all animals because they believed that whatever was inside them could burst out faster than from humans."}
{"translation": "They gave a wide berth to the friendly cows which might possibly go berserk today and the dogs even the old ones that could barely stand but might still go for their throats today."}
{"translation": "On days like these anything was possible; even a mangy mutt could bite through one's throat much more likely than an okapi."}
{"translation": "Except for Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the villagers were mostly not superstitious."}
{"translation": "They did carefree all that you are not supposed to do with superstition: they sat calmly under wall clocks, even though you can die from superstition, they slept with their heads towards the door, although this means in superstition that one will soon be carried out feet first through exactly this door."}
{"translation": "They hung up laundry between Christmas and New Year's Eve which is tantamount to suicide or aiding and abetting murder according to superstition as warned by Elsbeth."}
{"translation": "They weren't scared when the screech owl called at night when a horse in the stable was heavily sweating, when a dog whined at night with his head lowered."}
{"translation": "The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, with no stops along the way."}
{"translation": "Since our first train ride, we always played the same game: We stood with our backs to the windows and faced the opposite train doors, Martin closed his eyes, and I looked out the window next to Martin's back."}
{"translation": "In first class, I listed everything I saw during the ride, and Martin tried to memorize it."}
{"translation": "He did very well, so in the second year, I didn't need to list anything anymore, and Martin, with his back to the window and eyes closed, could almost perfectly recite everything I saw through the dirty train window: \"Wire factory,\" he said, exactly at the moment we passed the wire factory."}
{"translation": "\"Now field."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "The crazy Hassel's farmhouse."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Woods."}
{"translation": "Woods."}
{"translation": "High seat one."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Woods."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Waide."}
{"translation": "Weide."}
{"translation": "Tire factory."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "Meadow."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "High seat two."}
{"translation": "Woods."}
{"translation": "Farm."}
{"translation": "Field."}
{"translation": "Woods."}
{"translation": "Highseat three."}
{"translation": "Village."}
{"translation": "\"What else could it have been,\" said Selma, and that one could hardly mistake an okapi for any other animal."}
{"translation": "\"Well,\" I said, it could have been a deformed cow, a misassembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and rusty color, one couldn't exactly distinguish that in the dark, everything was pretty blurry."}
{"translation": "\"That's nonsense,\" said Selma, rubbing her forehead, \"that's unfortunately nonsense, Luise."}
{"translation": "She placed a slice of cheese on the bread, closed it, and put it in my butter bread box."}
{"translation": "\"Do you know when you dreamed that exactly?\""}
{"translation": "\"At three o'clock,\" said Selma."}
{"translation": "She was startled after the image of the okapi had retreated; she woke up sitting upright in bed staring at her nightgown in which she'd just dreamt of being on Uhlheck mountain."}
{"translation": "And then at her alarm clock: Three o'clock."}
{"translation": "\"We should probably not take this too seriously,\" said Selma\u2014but she spoke with the gravity of a TV detective dismissing an anonymous tip-off as not worthy of concern."}
{"translation": "\"What's up?\", I asked."}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma replied, opening the refrigerator, fetching a pack of sliced cheese and a liver sausage, and waving them both around in the air."}
{"translation": "\"What can we have on our sandwiches today?\" she asked, her voice still squeaky."}
{"translation": "\"Mousie,\" she added, and the squeaking and mouse-like sounds were really starting to get on my nerves."}
{"translation": "\"Cheese, please,\" I said, \"what's wrong with you?\""}
{"translation": "\"Nothing,\" Selma replied, \"I already said that."}
{"translation": "She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she was still fidgeting, she accidentally knocked the cheese off the cutting board with her wrist."}
{"translation": "Selma stopped and looked down at the cheese package as if it were something precious that had just broken into a thousand pieces."}
{"translation": "Selma had dreamed of an okapi three times in her life, and each time someone had died afterwards, which is why we were convinced that the dream of an okapi and death were inevitably connected."}
{"translation": "Our mind works that way."}
{"translation": "It can quickly make the most unrelated things belong together."}
{"translation": "For example, coffee pots and shoelaces, or deposit bottles and fir trees."}
{"translation": "When I slept below Selma, she would tell me stories with happy endings at bedtime."}
{"translation": "When I was younger, I would always hold her hand and place my thumb on her pulse, imagining that the whole world was beating in time with Selma's heart."}
{"translation": "I pictured the optician polishing lenses, Martin lifting weights, Elsbeth pruning her hedge, the grocer stacking juice boxes, my mother layering fir branches, my father stamping recipes, and everyone doing it all in perfect rhythm with Selma's heartbeat."}
{"translation": "That's how I always fell asleep, but now that I'm ten, Selma says I'm too old for that."}
