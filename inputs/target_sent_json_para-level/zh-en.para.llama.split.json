{"translation": "In the winter of 1993, the most important thing that happened to me was my father's return."}
{"translation": "He came back just a week before my mother's wedding."}
{"translation": "On a cold afternoon in December, he came to my school to find me."}
{"translation": "I ran towards the school gate, my heart racing with excitement."}
{"translation": "From afar, I saw him standing outside, smoking a cigarette."}
{"translation": "He was wearing a black overcoat, and his collar was turned up, covering half of his face."}
{"translation": "I don't know why, but even his appearance seemed strange and unfamiliar."}
{"translation": "My heart ached, and tears streamed down my face."}
{"translation": "I never thought my mother would remarry."}
{"translation": "Perhaps subconsciously, I felt that she should continue to suffer because of my father's departure, just like me."}
{"translation": "Moreover, I felt that she lacked the ability to find happiness."}
{"translation": "However, in reality, happiness may have found her instead."}
{"translation": "After all, as a beautiful woman, she didn't need to work hard or do much; she could simply stand still and be fine."}
{"translation": "I still remember that winter, which seemed to last forever."}
{"translation": "It was already mid-April, and the spring flowers had yet to bloom."}
{"translation": "The news of my parents' divorce had left you feeling down."}
{"translation": "We hadn't had any new games in a while, and every evening we would sit on the rooftop of the death tower, feeling listless."}
{"translation": "In the courtyard, there were more and more discarded body parts."}
{"translation": "We used hooks to gather them up and arranged them into a thousand-handed Guanyin."}
{"translation": "My father didn't have much of a clue about doing business, he just went to work for a distant relative who wasn't very familiar to him."}
{"translation": "My grandmother had a younger sister who went to Beijing early on and later got married and had children there."}
{"translation": "This cousin was the eldest son in their family and was always seen as an outsider within the entire clan."}
{"translation": "\"Just as you said, everyone has their own time of luck, and life is like a roller coaster."}
{"translation": "Mine was when I was eight years old."}
{"translation": "That autumn, my father left Jinan and went to Beijing alone."}
{"translation": "From then on, I never had a home again."}
{"translation": "I don't plan on going to the appointment."}
{"translation": "Whether it's because of something or nothing, I think we don't need to see each other again."}
{"translation": "I sat on the sofa, smoking one cigarette after another, watching the sky gradually darken."}
{"translation": "Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the door."}
{"translation": "The boy delivering water stood outside, holding a water tank and saying he had brought water for a household in the west suburbs."}
{"translation": "He wore a dirty gray woolen hat and had a dazed expression."}
{"translation": "Our conversation was going on with great difficulty."}
{"translation": "Every time we fell into silence, I felt my heart was being compressed, and I just wanted to quickly end this meeting."}
{"translation": "You seemed to have noticed, but you were still trying to find a topic to talk about."}
{"translation": "The tea had gone cold, and the white mist in the house had already dissipated."}
{"translation": "You finally got up to leave, and I just closed the door, feeling a sense of relief."}
{"translation": "The doorbell rang again, and you stood at the door, asking me to come to the small building later."}
{"translation": "I hadn't even had time to decline when you had already left the building."}
{"translation": "I walked into the kitchen and turned off the stove."}
{"translation": "The water had already boiled half a pot, and the entire room was shrouded in white mist."}
{"translation": "You sat down and watched me pour tea, asking, \"Do you still live with your grandmother and aunt?\""}
{"translation": "I told you that my grandmother had passed away, and now I live with my aunt."}
{"translation": "\"She never got married,\" you asked."}
{"translation": "\"Yes,\" I replied."}
{"translation": "The white breath you exhale from your mouth, the wind-tossed strands of hair on your forehead, the subtle tremble of your knees under the hem of your dress these convince me that the you before me is real, not a continuation of that dream from long ago."}
{"translation": "Eighteen years have passed, and it's no surprise that I don't recognize you."}
{"translation": "You haven't put on any makeup, and your pale face has a hint of puffiness, but you've still exceeded everyone's expectations and grown into a beautiful woman."}
{"translation": "That small, delicate face of yours still has a trace of the past, a hint of the city's hustle and bustle."}
{"translation": "You ask me if your appearance is different from how I imagined it."}
{"translation": "I can't help but smile wryly."}
{"translation": "To be honest, I've never thought about what you'd look like after growing up."}
{"translation": "For me, everything related to you has been locked away in a drawer, sealed with lacquer."}
{"translation": "Perhaps saying this might hurt someone's feelings, but I really haven't been expecting to see you again."}
{"translation": "I open my eyes."}
{"translation": "You are standing at the door."}
{"translation": "I do not know how long you have been standing there, perhaps you even saw me laughing in my dream."}
{"translation": "Also the sadness of waking up, and how I look in my weakest moments."}
{"translation": "Cheng Gong, you softly call out my name, your voice is very hoarse as if you have not spoken for a while."}
{"translation": "It's about to snow, the skies are seriously overcast, it's pitch black in the room."}
{"translation": "The water on the stove is boiling and bubbling away."}
{"translation": "After observing you carefully for a moment I am certain that I don't know you yet somehow under this dim light suddenly,I felt like this stranger opposite me has a deep connection with my life."}
{"translation": "This feeling sends chills down one's spine."}
{"translation": "Thinking hard then memories started flipping hastily through mind and thenyou said,\"I am Li Jiaqi\"."}
