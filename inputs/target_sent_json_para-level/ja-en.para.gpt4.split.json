{"translation": "Miho and Satsuki, perhaps due to their frequent encounters locally, share the same facial expressions and way of speaking."}
{"translation": "Particularly, their way of eating sweets is similar; they both break cookies into small pieces with their nailed hands and bring them to their mouths."}
{"translation": "I try to recall if this has always been the case, but my memory is vague."}
{"translation": "I wonder if those small habits and gestures that the two had when we last met have already drifted away somewhere."}
{"translation": "Miho is now married and has bought a used single-family home in her hometown, where friends often gather."}
{"translation": "Although there are times when she dreads going to her part-time job tomorrow, it's her only connection to the world outside of convenience stores, and a valuable opportunity to interact with \"ordinary women in their thirties\" who are the same age as her, so she tries to accept Miho's invitations as much as possible."}
{"translation": "Today too, with Miho and Yukari who brought along her young child, Satsuki who is married without children yet, and myself as members, we gathered at Miho's house bringing cake for tea time."}
{"translation": "At that moment, I was able to become a part of the world for the first time."}
{"translation": "It felt as if I had been born then."}
{"translation": "Me, a proper part of this world, was truly born on this day."}
{"translation": "For the two weeks leading up to the opening, we kept practicing relentlessly, pairing up and dealing with fellow employees as if they were imaginary customers."}
{"translation": "Smiling and bowing while looking into our \"customers'\" eyes, placing feminine products in paper bags, separating warm items from cold ones when packing them, or disinfecting our hands with alcohol when handling fast food orders."}
{"translation": "To get used to handling money, real currency was placed in the cash register."}
{"translation": "Though it was clearly marked \"training\" on receipts and despite being served by part-time workmates dressed in the same uniforms, it felt somewhat like playing store."}
{"translation": "My younger sister, two years my junior, was unlike me, a \"normal\" child."}
{"translation": "However, that didn't mean she kept her distance from me; on the contrary, she admired me."}
{"translation": "When my sister was scolded by our mother for something ordinary and different from what I would do, I would approach our mother and ask her why she was angry."}
{"translation": "Once the lecture ended because of my question to our mother, my sister always said \"thank you\" to me\u2014perhaps because she felt like I protected her."}
{"translation": "As I wasn't particularly interested in sweets or toys when we were growing up, I often gave them to her instead."}
{"translation": "As a result, she spent a great deal of time following me around."}
{"translation": "\"Dad likes yakitori, so let's grill this and eat it today,\" I said, clearly enunciating each word."}
{"translation": "Upon hearing me, my mother gasped in shock."}
{"translation": "The other child's mother next to her widened her eyes, nostrils, and mouth all at once in surprise as well."}
{"translation": "It was a funny face that almost made me laugh."}
{"translation": "But seeing her stare intently at what was in my hand made me realize that one bird wouldn't be enough."}
{"translation": "\"Should I get more?\""}
{"translation": "I asked, glancing at the two or three sparrows walking nearby."}
{"translation": "Snapping out of her daze finally, my mother cried out desperately with a scolding tone in her voice: \"Keiko!\"  \"We should bury the little birdie,\" she suggested in a low voice as if presenting an important task before us all."}
{"translation": "Look around you; everyone is crying because they have lost a friend."}
{"translation": "\"  \"Why? We're going to waste it though."}
{"translation": "At my question, mom fell silent."}
{"translation": "Quickly put canned coffee, cigarettes, and an American dog into a small-sized bag."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, the man jingling change in his pocket suddenly reached into his chest pocket."}
{"translation": "From this gesture, I quickly deduced that he intended to pay with electronic money."}
{"translation": "\"Welcome, good morning!\""}
{"translation": "With a slight bow, I take the can of coffee handed over by the male customer."}
{"translation": "\"Ah, and one of number five cigarettes too."}
{"translation": "\"Certainly."}
{"translation": "Swiftly grabbing a Marlboro Light Menthol, I scan it at the register."}
{"translation": "\"Could you please touch for age verification?\""}
{"translation": "While touching the screen, I notice his gaze shifting towards the showcase filled with fast food."}
{"translation": "I stop moving my fingers."}
{"translation": "Although I could ask 'Would you like anything else?, whenever it seems that he's doubting whether to purchase or not, I choose to step back and wait patiently."}
{"translation": "Reacting to the faint sound of coins, known as \"chali\", I turn and look toward the cash register."}
{"translation": "People who jingle coins in their palms or pockets are often those who are about to quickly buy cigarettes or a newspaper, so I'm sensitive to the sound of money."}
{"translation": "Sure enough, there was a man approaching the register with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand still shoved in his pocket."}
{"translation": "I swiftly move around inside the store and slide into behind the counter to avoid keeping customers waiting."}
{"translation": "The convenience store is filled with sound."}
{"translation": "The chime when a customer enters, the voice of an idol advertising new products over the in-store broadcast system."}
{"translation": "The callout of the clerk, the beep of scanning barcodes."}
{"translation": "The sound of items being placed in baskets, bags holding bread being grasped, and heels walking around inside the store."}
{"translation": "All these sounds intertwine to create 'the soundscape of a convenience store, consistently reaching my eardrums."}
