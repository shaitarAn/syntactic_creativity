{"translation": "Miho and Satsuki wear exactly the same expression and speak the same way, perhaps because they live close to each other and often meet up."}
{"translation": "The way they eat cookies is especially similar, both breaking off tiny pieces and putting them in their mouths with hands that have perfectly manicured nails."}
{"translation": "I couldn't help wondering whether they had always been like that, but my memory was hazy."}
{"translation": "The little habits and gestures they had last time I met them must have already been flushed out of my mind I thought to myself."}
{"translation": "After Miho married, she and her husband bought a secondhand house where she now often holds little parties with her friends."}
{"translation": "There are times when I feel like it's too much bother, knowing I have to work the next day."}
{"translation": "But it's the only connection I have to the world outside the convenience store and a precious opportunity to mingle with \"normal\" women my age, so I usually accept her invitations."}
{"translation": "Today there was Yukari and her young child, and Satsuki, who was married but still childless, and we had all brought cakes along to have with tea."}
{"translation": "At that moment, for the first time ever, I felt I'd become a part in the machine of society."}
{"translation": "I've been reborn, I thought."}
{"translation": "That day, I actually became a normal cog in society."}
{"translation": "For the two weeks prior to opening, we worked in pairs to role-play dealing with imaginary customers."}
{"translation": "We practiced looking the customer in the eye, smiling and bowing, cleaning our hands with alcohol before handling items from the hot-food cabinet, putting hot and cold items into separate bags, and sanitary products into paper bags."}
{"translation": "The money in the till was real so we would become accustomed to handling it, but the receipts were marked TRAINING in big letters, and our \"customers\" were our fellow uniformed workers, so it was rather like playing at shop."}
{"translation": "My little sister, who is two years younger than me, was a normal child."}
{"translation": "Even so, she never tried to avoid me; indeed, she adored me."}
{"translation": "Unlike me she was always being told off for silly little things, and whenever this happened I would go up to mother and ask her why she was so angry."}
{"translation": "This generally put an end to the lecture, and my sister always thanked me for it as if she thought I were protecting her."}
{"translation": "It also helped that I wasn't all that interested in sweets and toys and would often give them to her, and so she was always hanging around me."}
{"translation": "\"Daddy likes yakitori, doesn't he?"}
{"translation": "Let's grill it and have it for dinner!\""}
{"translation": "She looked at me, startled."}
{"translation": "Thinking she hadn't heard properly, I repeated what I'd said, this time clearly enunciating my words."}
{"translation": "The mother sitting next to her gaped at me, her eyes, nostrils, and mouth forming perfect O's."}
{"translation": "She looked so comical I almost burst out laughing."}
{"translation": "But then I saw her staring at the bird in my hand and I realized that one of these little birds probably wouldn't be enough for Daddy."}
{"translation": "\"Shall I get some more?\""}
{"translation": "I asked, glancing at two or three other birds strutting around."}
{"translation": "\"Keiko!\" my mother exclaimed reprovingly, finally coming to her senses."}
{"translation": "\"Let's make a grave for Mr. Budgie and bury him."}
{"translation": "Look, everyone's crying."}
{"translation": "His friends must be sad he died."}
{"translation": "The poor little thing!\""}
{"translation": "\"But it's dead."}
{"translation": "Let's eat it!\""}
{"translation": "My mother was speechless."}
{"translation": "I put the can of coffee, cigarettes, and corn dog into a small-size bag."}
{"translation": "Until then the man had been jingling the coins in his pocket, but now he suddenly moves his hand to his breast pocket as though something has just occurred to him."}
{"translation": "Instantly I deduce that he will use electronic money."}
{"translation": "\"Irasshaimas\u00e9!"}
{"translation": "Good morning, sir."}
{"translation": "I bow and take the can of coffee he holds out to me."}
{"translation": "\"Oh, and a pack of Marlboro Menthol Lights."}
{"translation": "\"Right away, sir."}
{"translation": "I take out a pack of the cigarettes and scan the bar code."}
{"translation": "\"Please confirm your age on the touch screen."}
{"translation": "As he does so, I notice him glance at the hot-food cabinet."}
{"translation": "I could ask him whether he'd like anything else, but when a customer appears to be dithering over whether or not to buy something, I make a point of taking a step back and waiting."}
{"translation": "Alerted by a faint clink of coins I turn and look over at the cash register."}
{"translation": "It's a sound I'm sensitive to, since customers who come just to buy cigarettes or a newspaper often jingle coins in their hand or pocket."}
{"translation": "And yes: as I'd thought, a man with a can of coffee in one hand, the other hand in his pocket, is approaching the till."}
{"translation": "I quickly move through the store, slide behind the counter, and stand at the ready so as not to keep him waiting."}
{"translation": "A convenience store is a world of sound."}
{"translation": "From the tinkle of the door chime to the voices of TV celebrities advertising new products over the in-store cable network, to the calls of the store workers, the beeps of the bar code scanner, the rustle of customers picking up items and placing them in baskets, and the clacking of heels walking around the store."}
{"translation": "It all blends into the convenience store sound that ceaselessly caresses my eardrums."}
