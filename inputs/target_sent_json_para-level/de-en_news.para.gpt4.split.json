{"translation": "INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT"}
{"translation": "My desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits."}
{"translation": "It represented a way for me to explore new horizons."}
{"translation": "I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century:"}
{"translation": "On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual."}
{"translation": "To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger."}
{"translation": "I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on \"action\" and forgot a fundamental element of human experience: sensations."}
{"translation": "Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations."}
{"translation": "Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers."}
{"translation": "Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has much more demanding and profound content."}
{"translation": "It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements."}
{"translation": "I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience."}
{"translation": "If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this respect."}
{"translation": "May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition."}
{"translation": "Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything."}
{"translation": "Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were constantly forced to question many of the principles previously considered inviolable."}
{"translation": "I would be happy if Fahrenheit like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you also does not pass you by without leaving a trace."}

{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed"}
{"translation": "The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics."}
{"translation": "That's also the reason for star No. 1."}
{"translation": "The second star is for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects."}
{"translation": "BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater."}
{"translation": "I had oriented myself based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L."}
{"translation": "Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle into a S or M with my bust size."}
{"translation": "In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips."}
{"translation": ".. but I could swim in the rest."}
{"translation": "Also, the lining material already came out when opening the package and spread everywhere."}
{"translation": "Just a shame."}
{"translation": "It will be sent back :/"}
{"translation": "Fast delivery and good workmanship"}
{"translation": "The jacket makes a great impression."}
{"translation": "We were surprised by the good workmanship."}
{"translation": "It can be worn well on both sides."}
{"translation": "We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled."}
{"translation": "She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will surely be worn next year as well."}
{"translation": "We can recommend an order."}
{"translation": "Robust Quality"}
{"translation": "I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and it's not optimal."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I mismeasured and the pad doesn't quite fit."}
{"translation": "But that's my mistake."}
{"translation": "I slightly altered it so it fits."}
{"translation": "The pad seems very robust and the edges are no longer damaged."}
{"translation": "You can use the groove or the entire surface."}
{"translation": "It worked without any problems."}
{"translation": "Nothing slips anymore."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again immediately."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately too big for under 1 year"}
{"translation": "The product itself is quite okay, but not for under one year."}
{"translation": "The chewing surface is too large for a small mouth."}
{"translation": "We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size."}
{"translation": "Now at 12 months, we've brought it out again and he can use it."}
{"translation": "He hasn't been able to bite anything off with his few existing teeth."}
{"translation": "And when it's been in the fridge, it soothes him a lot."}
{"translation": "Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately returning"}
{"translation": "I was probably misled by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews here."}
{"translation": "I would like to preface by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use."}
{"translation": "A very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you."}
{"translation": "Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2. 8, the small Lowepro has now become too small and I need a replacement."}
{"translation": "On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance."}
{"translation": "When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed:"}
{"translation": "The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that."}
{"translation": "But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices ."}
{"translation": "Guys, that's just not true!"}
{"translation": "I really hoped that it was, but there can be no talk of that."}
{"translation": "The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "Even the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier."}
{"translation": "Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro."}
{"translation": "The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back."}
{"translation": "If I buy equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I unfortunately also have to spend the money for a decent backpack."}
{"translation": "Quality apparently has its price here."}
{"translation": "For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me."}
{"translation": "And it's not like the decision was difficult for me."}
{"translation": "When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back."}
{"translation": "What I liked was the color inside."}
{"translation": "Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior."}
{"translation": "For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately disappointed by the third part"}
{"translation": "So far, I liked the Electric series by E. L."}
{"translation": "Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book."}
{"translation": "I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part."}
{"translation": "In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out."}
{"translation": "Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and then acts like a little child and sulks in every argument?!"}
{"translation": "At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and he had heard it himself."}
{"translation": "But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor."}
{"translation": "I had hoped that this was the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary."}
{"translation": "I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex."}
{"translation": "That would bring more tension back into the story."}
{"translation": "Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns!"}
{"translation": "First of all:"}
{"translation": "The movie is not as bad as many people say."}
{"translation": "Sure, the story is totally contrived, and always designed according to the same formula."}
{"translation": "If you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends."}
{"translation": "And the message is always the same: Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns!"}
{"translation": "And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us!"}
{"translation": "How often during the movie I thought (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals are computer-generated):"}
{"translation": "Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to your eyes."}
{"translation": "Therefore, Jurassic World"}
{"translation": "Fallen"}
{"translation": "Kingdom is really well made."}
{"translation": "It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film."}
{"translation": "We consistently destroy animals, the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves."}
{"translation": "Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance!"}
{"translation": "Empathy for the environment and living beings: none."}
{"translation": "4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Still, well-made popcorn cinema."}
{"translation": "A quiet, sensitive film"}
{"translation": "Some expect a film like 8 Mile here."}
{"translation": "This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be."}
{"translation": "This film is primarily \"French\" it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and can bring one to tears if one engages with it and expects nothing from it that it doesn't want to be."}
{"translation": "Problematic"}
{"translation": "Tastes like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't matter."}
{"translation": "5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing."}
{"translation": "My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm!"}
{"translation": "Bloating like never before!"}
{"translation": "Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day."}
{"translation": "Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week."}
{"translation": "It is worth noting that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately only noticed too late), while the larger one got a full 5?"}
{"translation": "That is very very strange!"}
{"translation": "Terrible smell and poor results!"}
{"translation": "I dyed my blonde hair to a chocolate brown with an intense tint in October, in February/March I used this hair color remover."}
{"translation": "I applied the product twice."}
{"translation": "The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible!"}
{"translation": "However, the result was not too bad, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (somewhat darker)."}
{"translation": "Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it again, as instructed in the manual for unsatisfactory results."}
{"translation": "This time it was a complete waste of time!"}
{"translation": "It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first attempt."}
{"translation": "The worst part was, it still smelled weeks after the application."}
{"translation": "No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away."}
{"translation": "Highly Recommended"}
{"translation": "I have been taking the tablets for quite a long time now, always one tablet every 5 days."}
{"translation": "My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and a prolonged additional illness."}
{"translation": "I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2."}
{"translation": "This is working very well."}
{"translation": "I feel fitter and much more comfortable."}
{"translation": "I sleep better and get out of bed more easily."}
{"translation": "The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets."}
{"translation": "Absolutely recommendable."}
{"translation": "Function not entirely flawless!!!"}
{"translation": "After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very disturbing:"}
{"translation": "1) Over time, the case has problems \"connecting\" with the phone."}
{"translation": "This means that it no longer charges even though the \"Power On/Off\" button has been pressed for 3 seconds."}
{"translation": "Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect."}
{"translation": "2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I have almost lost it several times."}
{"translation": "These may not be many major defects, but I believe that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function and therefore I am very disappointed with the product for the cost of 30\u20ac, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months."}
{"translation": "Way too expensive, too thin and disappointing"}
{"translation": "I don't know how all these good reviews came about."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, it's really just a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form."}
{"translation": "The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better."}
{"translation": "I expected much more from these cloths, it is also really very thin."}
{"translation": "Since I have used it, I unfortunately cannot return it."}
{"translation": "I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side."}
{"translation": "The price for these cloths is far too high, more than 2 euros should not be given."}
{"translation": "I doubt the frequency response"}
{"translation": "I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke."}
{"translation": "Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (it has already fallen into the shower), reproduces bass as bass, Bluetooth works great."}
{"translation": "Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off."}
{"translation": "it can reproduce sound very loudly."}
{"translation": "yes."}
{"translation": ". what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker."}
{"translation": "As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency."}
{"translation": "However, this causes a problem."}
{"translation": "Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet."}
{"translation": "While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough."}
{"translation": "My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in volume."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I have to deduct a star for that."}
{"translation": "I expected more from the frequency response."}
{"translation": "very bad"}
{"translation": "In a few places, the paint had chipped off and if you just ran your hand over it, the paint would come off in some places."}
{"translation": "We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense."}
{"translation": "They would only replace the damaged parts but how if both dressers were damaged."}
{"translation": "Poor service from the manufacturer."}
{"translation": "Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money."}
{"translation": "Kudos to Amazon."}
{"translation": "Better to spend a bit more money"}
{"translation": "The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality."}
{"translation": "Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself."}
{"translation": "The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard."}
{"translation": "There was no additional protection."}
{"translation": "Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged."}
{"translation": "I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product."}
{"translation": "The included adhesive hardly holds, but it sticks properly like chewing gum that doesn't harden."}
{"translation": "Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick."}
{"translation": "Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together."}
{"translation": "The stencils are partially incompletely punched out."}
{"translation": "For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product."}
{"translation": "I'm not dissatisfied."}
{"translation": "The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear."}
{"translation": "+ Magnetic closures + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired."}
{"translation": "Doors slam due to magnets (can possibly be balanced with rubber knobs) some unclean spots"}
{"translation": "The supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I had no others and since there was no trophy in the house, I glued them with craft glue) the brackets for the insert shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it)"}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied."}
{"translation": "Also, I find it a bit too expensive for that."}
{"translation": "I like the coffee."}
{"translation": ".but"}
{"translation": ".. there are only 3 stars."}
{"translation": "The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive)."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!)."}
{"translation": "The additional plastic waste (individually packaged see photo) means a star deduction for me."}
{"translation": "I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points."}
{"translation": "It gets on my nerves"}
{"translation": "The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up."}
{"translation": "However, the natural sounds are terrible and extremely loud."}
{"translation": "I couldn't turn them down."}
{"translation": "Probably a defect, supposedly it's possible."}
{"translation": "The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I would immediately fall out of bed."}
{"translation": "In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand."}
{"translation": "I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning."}
{"translation": "But when it was time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me."}
{"translation": "I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light."}
{"translation": "I also liked that it has a battery, so you don't have to re-enter the time and alarm time in case of a power outage."}
{"translation": "But for the reasons mentioned, it was returned."}
{"translation": "Lighting great, workmanship insufficient"}
{"translation": "I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point. .."}
{"translation": "There was also nothing in the box."}
{"translation": "\"Pay for 6 receive 4\" is not a good deal."}
{"translation": "Surely Amazon would have handled this generously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period."}
{"translation": "So I see this as my mistake and live with it."}
{"translation": "However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs so far the only reason for deducting two stars."}
{"translation": "The light itself is great."}
{"translation": "The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit."}
{"translation": "The light color tends more towards cool white."}
{"translation": "Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc."}
{"translation": "For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light."}
{"translation": "Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb."}
{"translation": "However, other lamps can do this too and maybe I will also get intact specimens according to the order there."}
{"translation": "If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating."}
{"translation": "I try to answer questions quickly."}
{"translation": "Great"}
{"translation": "I have received the items, and I would like to share my first impressions."}
{"translation": "Yes, positive."}
{"translation": "I thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not."}
{"translation": "**The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand."}
{"translation": "**All the utensils have a hole in the handle for hanging."}
{"translation": "**The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use with coated pans."}
{"translation": "**They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 \u2109."}
{"translation": "**They do not conduct heat, so they can be handled directly."}
{"translation": "**However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone."}
{"translation": "But a quick wipe and they're gone."}
{"translation": "In conclusion, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it."}
{"translation": "B-Stock Sold as New Stock"}
{"translation": "Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch."}
{"translation": "Delivery within 24 hours."}
{"translation": "Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all parts."}
{"translation": "We found that the part had already been installed once."}
{"translation": "We noticed significant scratches and scuffs on all assembly parts."}
{"translation": "The hose connections/fittings were all damaged."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately)."}
{"translation": "Only then did we see that there were also scratch marks / streaks on the chrome faucet itself."}
{"translation": "This part was probably already delivered and returned."}
{"translation": "We will keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn't matter how it looks there."}
{"translation": "Our conclusion;"}
{"translation": "We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods."}
{"translation": "I find it simply sad that customers are being deceived like this!!!"}
{"translation": "The product itself is top-notch, unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months."}
{"translation": "In principle, I am very satisfied with this product."}
{"translation": "The installation was very easy, and the range is very good, with no problems transmitting from inside to outside."}
{"translation": "I also find the design of the device appealing."}
{"translation": "It is very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame."}
{"translation": "The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the outside values seems to be broken."}
{"translation": "The thermometer still seems to be intact, as it continues to display plausible values."}
{"translation": "However, the hygrometer seems to be gone, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values of outside humidity."}
{"translation": "This is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected place and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars."}
{"translation": "Powerful mower with weak catcher"}
{"translation": "Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent."}
{"translation": "The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression."}
{"translation": "The engine is strong and it produces a nice cut."}
{"translation": "The noise level is not impressively low, but okay."}
{"translation": "The big drawback is unfortunately the grass catcher."}
{"translation": "For one, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between."}
{"translation": "If you set it down briefly when it's full, it naturally gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out."}
{"translation": "Worse, however, is that the otherwise practical fill level indicator already shows red when the grass catcher is only half full."}
{"translation": "This wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from that point on."}
{"translation": "Emptying the catcher on a large lawn area when it's only half full can't be the solution."}
{"translation": "Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me."}
{"translation": "Good device for monitoring"}
{"translation": "I have two of these devices."}
{"translation": "The device can be easily integrated via the app."}
{"translation": "The included plug-in sensor cable, which can be extended if necessary, is very good."}
{"translation": "The device is solidly built."}
{"translation": "Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app."}
{"translation": "For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars."}
{"translation": "The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is quite fiddly to close again."}
{"translation": "One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls."}
{"translation": "This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even if you place it near the router."}
{"translation": "You have to remove the batteries and reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects."}
{"translation": "This should actually work without removing the battery."}
{"translation": "There is always an alarm when the connection is lost."}
{"translation": "The alarm tone could be a bit louder."}
{"translation": "3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY"}
{"translation": "I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed correctly to this day."}
{"translation": "The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there, and the screw on the front right is practically falling out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low."}
{"translation": "The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table."}
{"translation": "Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything like this."}
{"translation": "Regarding the assembly:"}
{"translation": "The assembly was quite trouble-free, it would only be helpful to show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous."}
{"translation": "I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received a reply."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, returning it is no longer possible."}
{"translation": "I had expected a bit more."}
{"translation": "Robust and precise, I'm positively surprised."}
{"translation": "My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed."}
{"translation": "This one here makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements."}
{"translation": "Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away."}
{"translation": "The packaging of the caliper is simple, but fully serves its purpose."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods."}
{"translation": "I can only give full marks for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper."}
{"translation": "From me, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household."}
{"translation": "Disgusting, persistent smell"}
{"translation": "I bought the bracelet and initially did not wear it because it emitted a disgusting smell."}
{"translation": "To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it was constantly \"aired out\"."}
{"translation": "Since return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it."}
{"translation": "I advise against buying it."}
{"translation": "Okay for the price"}
{"translation": "The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too big for me, making it look quite massive."}
{"translation": "The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice."}
{"translation": "However, the chain is overall very simply made, so I have already torn the clasp twice."}
{"translation": "So far, I have always been able to repair it, but I think that it will not last/hold for long."}
{"translation": "But for the low price, you simply cannot expect anything really high quality."}
{"translation": "Very beautiful piece of jewelry"}
{"translation": "A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds!"}
{"translation": "You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!"}
{"translation": "I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more pliable."}
{"translation": "Just a note:"}
{"translation": "if you have something magnetic on your arm:"}
{"translation": "The clasp is made of steel!"}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, junk!"}
{"translation": "I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods."}
{"translation": "The base station was fine."}
{"translation": "Now to the function:"}
{"translation": "It only connects after some fiddling."}
{"translation": "if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, did the transmitters finally connect."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station."}
{"translation": "Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different!"}
{"translation": "All in all, not usable for me!"}
{"translation": "The thing went back!"}
{"translation": "I would definitely advise against buying, it only brings trouble!"}
{"translation": "Transport damage"}
{"translation": "Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3. 5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted."}
{"translation": "I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit."}
{"translation": "I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and the current pump lasts a bit longer."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken."}
{"translation": "The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box."}
{"translation": "I kept the pump anyway, as mentioned above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance."}
{"translation": "It could have been better thought out."}
{"translation": "As I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than constantly carrying around a huge bunch of keys."}
{"translation": "Initially, everything went quite well."}
{"translation": "However, the paint quickly started to peel off and the screws had to be constantly tightened."}
{"translation": "It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin."}
{"translation": "I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't have immediately ruined the entire screw."}
{"translation": "Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys."}
{"translation": "It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths using the various parts, but once you've screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it all apart again."}
{"translation": "Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance, and skill."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I assembled it, rendering the entire thing useless."}
{"translation": "Conclusion:"}
{"translation": "If at all, then only for once all necessary keys and then never again, but at the price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative."}
{"translation": "Does not quite match the specified dimensions"}
{"translation": "The zippers are smooth, the material seems sturdy, and all of this at a featherweight."}
{"translation": "Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to truly assess the product after the first use."}
{"translation": "I can already say that the height is less than stated."}
{"translation": "At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything for a three-week vacation there."}
{"translation": "If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase as before."}
{"translation": "It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, as there were two smaller bags/pouches included in the round cosmetic bag."}
{"translation": "Not high-quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway."}
{"translation": "The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally."}
{"translation": "I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay."}
{"translation": "So-so"}
{"translation": "So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas."}
{"translation": "Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked."}
{"translation": "Battery?"}
{"translation": "Replaced."}
{"translation": "But it still doesn't work."}
{"translation": "So, I might as well have thrown the money directly into the trash can."}
{"translation": "Care is always good!"}
{"translation": "The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle."}
{"translation": "I could not discern an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable."}
{"translation": "Long battery life"}
{"translation": "The headphones are wonderfully protected."}
{"translation": "Included were two black cables."}
{"translation": "The battery life lasts a very long time."}
{"translation": "Definitely completely sufficient sound."}
{"translation": "I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable."}
{"translation": "The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear."}
{"translation": "The weight is also kept very low."}
{"translation": "Purchase recommendation in this price range."}
{"translation": "Chic dress"}
{"translation": "A very beautiful dress that is suitable for a variety of occasions."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale."}
{"translation": "It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended)."}
{"translation": "I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slim upper arms as the model in the picture)."}
{"translation": "But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions."}
{"translation": "Stay away."}
{"translation": "It doesn't get any worse."}
{"translation": "I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days."}
{"translation": "The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop."}
{"translation": "It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible."}
{"translation": "DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized at best unreliably."}
{"translation": "The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes grinding noises as you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives."}
{"translation": "After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't get any better or the disc is finally recognized."}
{"translation": "But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or do anything at all."}
{"translation": "This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze."}
{"translation": "In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included."}
{"translation": "If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles."}
{"translation": "It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty."}
{"translation": "First and foremost, I want to point out that the two USB ports are somewhat deceptive, as only the port that points upwards is a USB port."}
{"translation": "The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless."}
{"translation": "I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed."}
{"translation": "I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs."}
{"translation": "But apart from the aesthetics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably."}
{"translation": "And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like it would with a normal extension cord."}
{"translation": "So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is somewhat limited :-)."}
{"translation": "Small but powerful!"}
{"translation": "I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display."}
{"translation": "With IOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth."}
{"translation": "This works very well."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, the audio output was as expected."}
{"translation": "Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this."}
{"translation": "The HDMI output is practical."}
{"translation": "I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via BT and the HDMI on the TV."}
{"translation": "Simultaneous charging is not a problem."}
{"translation": "Sound is delivered via HDMI."}
{"translation": "What else do I use my PlayStation for :P"}
{"translation": "There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet."}
{"translation": "This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder."}
{"translation": "It doesn't fit with my case and the adapter."}
{"translation": "Well, it holds securely and has contact anyway."}
{"translation": "All in all, a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions."}
{"translation": "In addition, it's very small and sturdily made from a piece of aluminum."}
{"translation": "The price-performance ratio is right."}
{"translation": "Plenty of power"}
{"translation": "Top device."}
{"translation": "It's been running for months without any problems."}
{"translation": "It's not exactly light or quiet but it delivers a lot of power."}
{"translation": "I find the middle temperature setting a bit too cool and therefore always use level 2."}
{"translation": "It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well."}
{"translation": "And I also like the simple design."}
{"translation": "Competing products often look like spaceships."}
{"translation": "Very good"}
{"translation": "The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not give a cheap impression."}
{"translation": "In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed."}
{"translation": "Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation."}
{"translation": "Great product with weak battery"}
{"translation": "We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised."}
{"translation": "In live mode, the location is accurate to about 0. 5m."}
{"translation": "In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does tend to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing."}
{"translation": "I would buy it again at any time."}
{"translation": "However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer."}
{"translation": "Currently, it lasts about 1. 5 days."}
{"translation": "A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great."}
{"translation": "There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste, the battery doesn't need to last that long for us and we find changing it daily impractical."}
{"translation": "You should be spending time with your dog, not with his collar :-)."}
{"translation": "The app also works perfectly."}
{"translation": "After a few weeks of garbage"}
{"translation": "We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes."}
{"translation": "They fit well and seem to be comfortable."}
{"translation": "However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more."}
{"translation": "Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used."}
{"translation": "With the last pair, it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, this was not the case."}
{"translation": "The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended."}
{"translation": "Fits perfectly but original?"}
{"translation": "My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair."}
{"translation": "These, however, appear poorly made at first glance."}
{"translation": "They are just as comfortable as the ones I previously owned."}
{"translation": "At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly made and the heel strap is quite loose and will likely not last five years like my previous ones."}
{"translation": "I'm curious!"}
{"translation": "Surprisingly good"}
{"translation": "Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical."}
{"translation": "However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck."}
{"translation": "The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump."}
{"translation": "About the mattress:"}
{"translation": "I test laid it in the car (Citroen Berlingo)."}
{"translation": "I noticed that there is some mold on one side."}
{"translation": "I wiped it off and hope that it does not reappear."}
{"translation": "A lying test was carried out in the inflated state."}
{"translation": "It is comfortable to lie on and is perfect for the festival."}
{"translation": "Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury."}
{"translation": "The mattress fits wonderfully into my car."}
{"translation": "We removed the seats in the back beforehand."}
{"translation": "So it fits perfectly."}
{"translation": "The air pump:"}
{"translation": "The air pump has different adapters."}
{"translation": "The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump."}
{"translation": "The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter."}
{"translation": "However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point)."}
{"translation": "Since my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the pump worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time."}
{"translation": "Overall, I am very excited about the mattress."}
{"translation": "I am looking forward to the stress test at the festival."}
{"translation": "I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time."}
{"translation": "Also, that the mold does not reappear."}
{"translation": "After the test, I can definitely recommend it."}
{"translation": "If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible)."}
{"translation": "Definitely not worth more than 10\u20ac. .."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1."}
{"translation": "For the fast shipping."}
{"translation": "2. For the idea of the toy."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the calendar tore open on day 1 due to poor craftsmanship, revealing several doors."}
{"translation": "By the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts as they were practically falling out."}
{"translation": "The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car to attach the parts."}
{"translation": "Once the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play."}
{"translation": "(Mostly the windshield."}
{"translation": "This is also very difficult to reattach."}
{"translation": "I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"translation": "Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better."}
{"translation": "a real"}
{"translation": "drone"}
{"translation": "I am thrilled with the drone."}
{"translation": "My 7-year-old daughter flies it."}
{"translation": "It flies very well indoors and the 5 min."}
{"translation": "Flight time is usually more than enough."}
{"translation": "I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly at this price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem."}
{"translation": "Nice contact for questions."}
{"translation": "The game is okay but can only be played with mandatory use of Steam."}
{"translation": "I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it wasn't a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game."}
{"translation": "That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous."}
{"translation": "Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which certainly wouldn't be the case with a pure installation of the game."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life."}
{"translation": "I was really looking forward to the watch."}
{"translation": "The design and appearance were great, messages etc were displayed without any problems."}
{"translation": "The operation worked well."}
{"translation": ". and yet I am sending it back."}
{"translation": "The big catch: the battery and its lifespan."}
{"translation": "Charged in the evening, left on the shelf overnight and 11% less battery in the morning without use."}
{"translation": "If many messages came during the day, the battery was already depleted by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore."}
{"translation": "Therefore, it's not useful for me."}
{"translation": "Very unfortunate."}
{"translation": "Elegant case with limitations"}
{"translation": "For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case."}
{"translation": "I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert a credit card."}
{"translation": "This case offers that."}
{"translation": "If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit."}
{"translation": "One is enough for me."}
{"translation": "The leather case seems sturdy and well made."}
{"translation": "It looks elegant."}
{"translation": "The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, with only cutouts at the connections."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case."}
{"translation": "The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case."}
{"translation": "Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO, it doesn't work."}
{"translation": "Accessories like the Galaxy Buds can therefore only be charged when the case is off."}
{"translation": "Otherwise, it's really chic and well made!"}
{"translation": "High-quality case with tempered glass film"}
{"translation": "A robust case with a proper armored glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11."}
{"translation": "It fits very well and can also be easily applied."}
{"translation": "The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty."}
{"translation": "A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio."}
{"translation": "This case gives the phone some grip."}
{"translation": "It is not too bulky and fits tightly on the phone."}
{"translation": "Overall a good purchase."}
