"Shut up," the optician said again, louder, and walked faster, "Selma rarely finds anything threatening or repugnant."
He was completely right about that, and with it had unfortunately said more than he should have in response to the voices.
But she may find love repugnant after all, the voices hissed.
There is a reason why the truth was hidden for so long.
"Cowardice that was," said the optician, shifting his leather bag to the other hip as both nudging from his bag and nudging from those voices gradually began to hurt him.
"Prudence it was," replied those voices, "Fear is sometimes a good counselor," they added and hummed a theme song of an early evening series.
The optician now slowed down.
The walk to Selma's house which usually took ten minutes seemed like a day trip suddenly a day trip with an awful lot of baggage.
That was true.
The dog was the color of slushy snow, he was a washed-out gray and shaggy like an exclusive Irish Wolfhound with nothing else in it.
His body was still small, but his paws were as big as bear claws, and we all knew what that meant.
Selma still stood elevated in front of the kitchen bench.
She looked long at the dog.
Then she looked at my father as if he were a gift ideas store.
Farmer Häubel was firmly convinced that Death would be polite, just as Farmer Häubel himself had been all his life.
He was sure that Death would not tear his life away from him, but gently take it from his hand.
He imagined Death knocking gently, only opening the door a crack and asking "May I?" to which Farmer Häubel would naturally agree.
"Of course," Farmer Häubel would say, "please come in", and Death would enter.
He would stand by Farmer Häubel's bed and ask: "Is this a good time for you? I can also come back later if you want."
Farmer Häubel would sit up and say, "No no, right now is perfect," he'd say: 'let's not put it off again; who knows when you'll be able to make time again", and then Death itself would sit down on the chair already waiting at the head of the bed.
It'd apologize beforehand for its cold hands which wouldn't bother Farmer Häuble at all before placing one hand over his eyes.
The people in the village were disturbed, it was evident from their demeanor, even though most of them tried to hide it.
This morning, just a few hours after Selma's dream, the villagers moved as if black ice had formed on all pathways, not only outdoors but also inside their homes black ice in their kitchens and living rooms.
They moved as if they were strangers to their own bodies as if all of their joints were inflamed and even the objects they handled were highly combustible.
All day long they lived with this underlying suspicion towards life itself and, when possible, that of others around them too.
They kept looking behind them to see if someone would spring upon them with a murderous intent someone who had lost his mind therefore having nothing substantial left to lose; and turned quickly back around because someone bereft of sanity could obviously attack from the front too.
They looked up regularly excluding the possibility of roof tiles falling down or branches or heavy lampshades knocking against something they stood under.
They avoided any kind of animals for the fear that an unpredictable outburst could erupt faster from these creatures than human beings themselves thus ignoring benign cows that might kick today; dogs being avoided despite many being so old that they barely managed standing much longer but who still seemed menacing enough today to go after necks unexpectedly:
On such days anything was possible Like an aged Dachshund potentially biting through one's throat perhaps more plausible than seeing an Okapi; it did not seem farfetched anymore .
Apart from Selma's sister-in-law Elsbeth, the people in the village were mostly not superstitious.
They nonchalantly did everything that one must not do when believing in superstitions: they sat casually under wall clocks, even though superstition says one could die from that; they slept with their heads towards the door, although according to superstition this means that you will soon be carried out through exactly this door feet first.
Between Christmas and New Year's they hung up laundry, which as Elsbeth warned, in terms of superstition is equal to a suicide or aiding and abetting a murder.
They weren't startled when an owl called at night, when a horse sweated heavily in the stable, or when a dog howled at night with its head lowered.
The train ride lasted fifteen minutes, there were no stops in between.
Since our first train ride, we always played the same game: We stood with our backs to the windows at the opposite train doors, Martin closed his eyes, I looked out of the window of the train door which was at Martin's back.
In first grade, I recited to Martin everything I saw during the journey and Martin tried to memorize it all.
He succeeded very well, so that in second grade I didn't list anything anymore and Martin, with his back to the window and eyes closed, could almost recite everything that I just saw through the fogged-up train window: "Wire factory," he said right at moment as we passed by a wire factory.
"Now field.
Pasture.
The farm of crazy Hassel.
Meadow.
Forest.
Forest.
Deer stand one.
Field/Forest/Meadow/Pasture/Pasture/Tire Factory/Village/Pasture/Field/Deer Stand Two/Small forest/Farm/Field/Woods/Deer stand three/Village."
"What else could it have been," said Selma, stating that an okapi could hardly be mistaken for another animal.
"Well," I said, it could also have been a malformed cow, a wrongly assembled giraffe, a whim of nature, and the stripes and the rust red color couldn't be recognized accurately in the night because everything was very blurry.
"That's nonsense," Selma replied rubbing her forehead; "unfortunately that's nonsense Luise."
She put cheese on bread and put it in my lunchbox.
"Do you remember when exactly you dreamt?"
"Around three o'clock," said Selma.
She had jerked awake after the image of the okapi had receded; she woke up sitting upright in bed staring at her nightgown which she had been wearing while standing on Uhlheck in her dream then at the clock.
Three o'clock.
"We should probably not take this so seriously," Selma said but with an air of a detective who doesn't take anonymous letters too seriously.
"What's the matter?", I asked.
"Nothing", Selma sing-songed, opening the fridge, taking out a packet of sliced cheese and a liver sausage and waving them both in the air.
"What would you like on your sandwich today?", she trilled.
"Little mouse," she added after it, and her trilling voice and 'little mouse' were indeed alarming.
"Cheese, please," I said, "what's wrong with you?"
"Nothing," Selma repeated in her sing-song voice, "I just told you."
She spread butter on a slice of bread, and as she kept fidgeting around, she knocked off the cheese from the counter with her wrist by accident.
Now still standing quietly at last , Selma gazed down at the packet of cheese as if it was something precious that had shattered into a thousand pieces.
Selma had dreamed of an okapi three times in her life, and each time afterwards someone had died, so we were convinced that the dream of an okapi and death were inevitably linked.
Our mind works like this.
It can ensure in a very short time that the most outlandish things belong together firmly.
Coffee pots and shoelaces, for example, or deposit bottles and fir trees.
When I slept downstairs at Selma's, she would tell me stories with happy endings by the side of the bed.
When I was younger, I used to wrap my hand around her wrist after the stories, placing my thumb on her pulse and imagining that the whole world did everything in sync with Selma's heartbeat.
I imagined how the optician ground lenses, Martin lifted a weight, Elsbeth trimmed her hedge, how the retailer arranged juice boxes in shelves, my mother stacked fir branches one on top of another, my father stamped prescriptions and all of this happened exactly to Selma's heart rhythm.
This always reliably lulled me to sleep but now at ten years old, Selma thought I was getting too old for that.
