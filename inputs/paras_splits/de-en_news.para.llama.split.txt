Diego Cocca will be the new national coach of Mexico.
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup alongside the USA and Canada, featuring 48 teams for the first time.
Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino as head coach, whose contract was not renewed after the team's early exit from the World Cup in Qatar.
The 50-year-old was not considered a favorite for the position until recently.
He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November, and his unexpected appointment as national coach caused controversy within the club.
Geesthacht: New signs should encourage reforestation.
Franko Stein (Environmental Department, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nature Conservation Association) are setting up plant signs in the pedestrian zone.
The 'Geesthacht blüht auf' campaign also includes information on what is currently blooming there in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht is blooming.
The Nabu, in cooperation with the city administration, has launched an action with the slogan "Geesthacht blüht auf" (Geesthacht is blooming).
With the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, kindergartens, businesses, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015.
The goal is to create extensive flower islands throughout the Geesthacht city area, where insects can find food at any time.
"In favorable weather conditions, bees are already flying out in January to search for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from the Geesthacht Nabu.
He himself keeps beehives on his property.
To ensure that the initiative doesn't remain the sole domain of environmental activists and the city's environmental department, explanatory signs about the plants are being placed in private gardens, reaching a wider audience.
There are around 50 signs so far.
Passersby can thus inform themselves about what's blooming here, and the hope is that hobby gardeners will be inspired to plant similar species at home.
The wild hare season started during the first week of January.
Younger dates include shrubs such as winter skunk cabbage and snowball bushes in the pedestrian zone.
They have been in the ground in the Kübel at Bergedorer Street for a year now, are showing their first delicate white and pink flowers, and have recently been labeled.
"The winter skunk cabbage is a very spreading shrub and can grow up to two meters tall and three meters wide," can be read among other information about the ideal location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that the flowers are not only blooming on the beet plants now.
The wild hazel has already started its season in the first week of January, blooming particularly abundantly along the path at the slope, in Gutenberg Street, Wilhelm-Holert Street, Fahrendofer Way, and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to the Munich East Station!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 pm sharp to perform a lively step dance together, they are an incredible 277 years young, pardon the pun!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (born January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is the highlight of the week.
"Dancing and stepping is my life, without it I can't imagine."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (nearly 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing the night away.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena, Thuringia in 1926.
She was a soubrette, what one would call a musical performer today, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk.
"I spent my life dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79, Elfriede Widmann is the youngest member of the round of step dancers.
She says, "We're just having fun with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
The step dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world.
With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music.
The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician.
The English term for this is "tap dance" and the French "claquettes."
The Spanish flamenco could have influenced the step dance, where the tips of the shoes are nailed, creating a clear tone when dancing.
Sissi Engl, 77, is the heart and soul of the dance studio at the East Station.
She's an actress, dancer, and choreographer.
"We're a big family here, everyone's welcome, young and old, big and small."
"What's the recipe for a long life?"
"I stay young through movement," says the 102-year-old to BILD.
Her advice to all: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
"Analog in Dialogue The Limits of the Digital"
With advancing digitalization, many people are increasingly craving the analog.
The rapid pace at which our daily lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for how to handle it and adapt our communication and work habits accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden.
In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, there were three options.
Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line.
Or you knew someone in the exclusive group in the neighborhood and could use their phone to call your relatives while sharing a bottle of Radeberger beer.
Or you had to search for a payphone.
Unforgettable was the smell of the plastic receiver and the sound of the coins clinking in the machine.
My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face while calling video calls, I thought, what a wonderful thing that would be!
How much longer in Moldova?
14 days for a new government.
Or, more idiomatically:How much longer will it take in Moldova?
14 days to form a new government.
In Moldova (also known as Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
For that, the 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days.
Previously, Recean was one of the president's advisors.
After just one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned.
The pro-European government leader was under massive pressure, as she herself explained in her resignation statement apparently, she was targeted by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifices."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war.
The inflation rate is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, as it holds 63 out of 101 seats.
The confirmation of the new government chief and his cabinet is therefore unlikely to pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians with support from the Kremlin have become more popular.

Oberhof: Kühn Eighth in the World Championship Sprint.
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and won the sixth sprint race of the season.
The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his fellow countryman Ole Einar Björndalen.
The biathlon icon, who is working as a TV expert on location, remains the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals.
Even thick fog did not prevent Bö from collecting his second gold medal on the Rennsteig, following his successful title defense with Norway's mixed relay team on Wednesday.
Few people doubt that number three will follow in the hunt.
Bö is once again the clear favorite in pursuit.
His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for shooting errors up to a certain extent with ease.
At Doll, things were once again not going well.
After the veteran had squandered all chances at a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty round and had only managed sixth place, things didn't improve three days later.
Three penalty rounds in the prone shooting and two more standing were a major disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated his greatest success in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with a mere 0.7-second lead over Bö.
It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has stood on the podium only once this winter.
The Pyeongchang Olympian left without a word after his poor performance and did not give any interviews.
Roman Rees finished 19th, while the second World Cup debutant, David Zobel, came in 35th.
Biden receives
Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the value of democracy is at the forefront.
Both leaders look back at their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of democratic values during a visit with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," said Biden on Friday at the White House in Washington.
"We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength."
Lula replied, looking at his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula won a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October.
He took office on January 1st.
The transfer of power was marked by severe riots.
Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government seat in the capital city of Brasília in January.
The outbreak of violence in Brazil is eerily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula criticized Bolsonaro openly at the meeting with Biden.
His predecessor didn't prioritize international relations much.
"His world began and ended with fake news, morning, noon, and night," said Lula.
"Sounds familiar," replied Biden an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.

Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters?
They featured the members of the Red Army Faction who were declared wanted for denunciation and elimination.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, a mood was publicly stirred up against the most dangerous enemies of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say, of bourgeois democracy, let's say, of late capitalist society.
(Let's not mention the really dangerous ones in suits and ties.)
Now, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually behind Raudis in the S-Bahns or Onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with Putin's friends.
Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery.
Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are probably more "Russian friends" in this world than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, rather: Mrs. Wagenknecht is in places 1 to 5 (!), followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Now, I don't know anyone in my surroundings who reads this newspaper anymore.
If only someone did, it would be high time.
We've reached the familiar level where there's nothing left below.
And latest now, dialectically speaking, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all not yet completely confused, i.e. Peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militaristic people.
(And here, no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth.

Harald Glööckler (57) and his partner Dieter Schroth (74) have separated.
This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording.
He said: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for dissolution of his registered partnership through his family lawyer at the relevant court.
I won't comment on the details."

"Christian Sewing, CEO of Deutsche Bank, considers further interest rate hikes to be 'absolutely' necessary in the fight against high inflation.
'The inflationary risks are still significant.
Energy costs could easily rise again, and China's reopening could give prices a temporary boost,' Sewing said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag."
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the eurozone for the fifth time in a row in early February and announced a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16.
The key interest rate in the eurozone is now 3.0 percent.
The deposit rate, which banks receive for parking money with the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive.
This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates.
Higher credit interest rates can also lead to investments being postponed, resulting in weaker economic growth.
Even for highly indebted eurozone countries like Italy, rising interest rates are a burden.
"The consequences of sustained high inflation are much more severe than the higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing.
"Of course, we must keep that in mind, but a high debt level must not deter the ECB from taking decisive action."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the eurozone with an inflation rate of two percent.
This target has been far away for months.
In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates erode the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for a euro.
Soaring energy prices, which are a key driver of inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also President of the German Banking Association (BdB).
"I currently see this as the greatest danger to the German economy.
But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO
Stefan
Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany tempo" initiative announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects.
"It will require a political and societal dialogue.
And it may be a bit controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart.
He hopes that a set of rules will emerge that will not necessarily be as fast as the LNG terminals that were put into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before.
In the middle of December, after ten months of planning and construction, Germany's first terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened.
The aim was to partially close the gap in gas supplies due to missing Russian gas deliveries.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "German tempo" on the occasion.
In addition, the federal government has recently accelerated approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"It's quite reassuring at first that the government is taking swift action when it matters.
However, this shouldn't automatically mean that we'll always act so categorically and, for example, install a wind turbine in our neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung.
There should still be a negotiation process to determine what society considers right and wrong.
In the past, attempts were made with the classical rulebook, but they were unsuccessful.
"We should reconsider whether our previous approach was correct.
Perhaps we overdid it with the rulebook and made it too complicated."
"Given the many open tasks, such as upgrading the power grids, I don't envy the federal government and the involved companies," said Hartung.
"As a consumer of this energy, I absolutely need this upgrade and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against breakup of Bayer corporation
The IG BCE chemical workers' union is warning against a break-up of the Bayer corporation following an announced change in leadership.
"From the employees' perspective, Bayer is correctly positioned for the challenges of the future with its three business legs," said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's executive board and Bayer's supervisory board, in an interview with the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
The intended businesses are the pharmaceutical industry dealing with prescription medication, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medication, and the agricultural industry.
"The industry's transformation can only be achieved through a corporate policy that focuses on risk diversification and sustainability, rather than hedge fund activism."
Background is the announced CEO change at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical corporation on Thursday.
The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down this summer.
Taking over on June 1st will be Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical CEO of the Swiss rival Roche.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time.
The $63 billion acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto in 2018 has weighed heavily on the manager.
The purchase brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the herbicide glyphosate to the company's doorstep.
The Bayer stock has been in a downward spiral for years.
In 2019, shareholders even refused to grant the CEO discharge at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann did not want to extend his contract, which was actually set to run until 2024.
Long-term strategic investors had been putting pressure on him.
Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, including Bluebell Capital, have been involved.
According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the company to be split up.
The very small fund with unknown participation rate in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach.
A spin-off of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value, said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, in an interview with the Rheinische Post.
He does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris.
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are mobilizing a united protest against the government's plans on the streets.
Hundreds of thousands are set to demonstrate against the pension reform for the second time on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform for the fourth time on Saturday.
The unions have mobilized against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
Over a million people have taken to the streets twice already, and there have been nationwide strikes.
Last Tuesday, 750,000 protesters were counted.
A heated debate over the controversial reform has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Many people in France are already working beyond the age of 62, if they have not paid enough into their pension fund to receive a full pension by that age.
Opponents of the reform argue that people in physically demanding professions could hardly work any longer, and employees want to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not sacrifice their health entirely for their job.
Macron: Looming Deficit in Pension
Fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund.
As the population is getting older, employees would have to contribute more to support an increasing number of retirees.
To keep the pension amount stable, the population would have to work a bit longer.
The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of funding to balance the pension system.
The government doesn't just want to tighten things up at retirement age.
The already decided increase in the required contribution period for a full pension should be accelerated.
In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups should be abolished.
The minimum pension should increase to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important initiatives.
The first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there were already massive protests and strikes at the time.
Previous presidents have also tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success, but broad protests and strikes were a certainty.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support.
However, some lawmakers even from Macron's own faction still have reservations.
And greater than the fear of a close vote may be Macron's concern about debilitating strikes.
Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said he was counting on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they remain peaceful and do not lead to a blockade of the country.
Fine weather expected plenty of sunshine in the mountains
A powerful high-pressure area is situated over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany.
Does that mean that sunny weather can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
At least until midweek, calm high-pressure weather is expected in Germany.
"When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches the eye directly over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach.
"Although this high will shift a bit to the east over the course of the next week, it will still dominate the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel.
"Such a high can even be quite unpleasant and bring gloomy, gray fog to the low-lying areas for days on end, while the highlands of the mid-range mountains bask in pure sunshine."
The Sunday starts overcast and misty in most regions.
According to the DWD, it can also rain in some areas, especially in the Alps, but also in the southwest and parts of the west.
The cloud cover will thin out during the day, allowing the sun to shine through more frequently.
The rest of the country will remain heavily overcast or covered in high fog.
Temperatures will range from 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, with 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the increasingly stronger sun will again gnaw away at the high fog and be able to dissolve it gradually throughout the day," said the meteorologist.
In the Alpine foothills, in the higher elevations of the Mid-range Mountains, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, full sun is expected all day long, while elsewhere it will have to fight its way through the high fog.
The highs will be between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius, with 11 degrees expected in the Lower Rhine region, and only 3 degrees in the persistent gray skies in the southeast.
There will be light winds from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may be patchy fog or high fog in some low-lying areas.
Otherwise, the weather is expected to be mostly sunny after fog dissipates.
In high elevations, in wide parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and along the Alpine rim, the sun is expected to shine all day according to forecasts.
Temperatures will rise to 5 to 11 degrees Celsius depending on the amount of sunshine.
Dominator struggles: No World Cup medal for Goggia again
The heavily favored
Sofia Goggia has shown great disappointment after her exit in the downhill event of the alpine skiing world championships.
Meribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I could have," said the Italian woman in ZDF, after she had missed a goal and been eliminated.
At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years, winning four of the last six races in this discipline.
She won gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics and took silver at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
However, Goggia, known for her risky driving style, has yet to win a World Championship medal in her signature discipline.
She missed her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was on top of it.
It was a matter of hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of Swiss skier Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France.
"I'm disappointed.
I gave it my all.
But that's life."
Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts had expected and ultimately missed: "But they're not."

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation.
Kiev.
With the demand to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed upon during a joint telephone conference to draft a statement aimed at preventing attempts to return athletes from Russia and Belarus to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport announced on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of Great Britain.
It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter.
"And I made Great Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games.
We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Prior to this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives.
"While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions," Zelenskyy said.
He published his speech on his Telegram channel.
Due to the Russian attack, a neutral flag is ultimately stained with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott Ukraine views
Belarus as a warring party as well, since the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks.
Zelensky called on officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to competitions.
The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which he said has "unfortunately lost its integrity."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions.
Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes to compete.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior is also taking a stance.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sports announced after the talks that they had reiterated their rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes starting in Paris.
"There is no reason from our perspective to invite Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to competition.
Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community.
The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are on the wrong path," a spokesperson for the ministry said in response to a dpa inquiry.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January:
"Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum."
Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics should be separate.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sports competitions.
However, the IOC aims to allow athletes from both countries to return to the international stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly acknowledge the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.

"Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock strongly depleted"
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war.
They are talking about "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has lost half of its combat tanks in its aggressive war against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense.
"Probably half of the main tank inventory" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
Wallander did not provide any additional information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is expected to receive combat tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks.
Great Britain has agreed to deliver Challenger-2 tanks to Kiev in March.
Germany will deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks in a coalition with other states by April.
The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams tanks, but their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia will follow
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitri Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks.
"As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, rockets, and tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the Vice-Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk.
"It is clear that it is natural for us in this case to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks."
A law has been in effect in Russia since last summer that enables a stronger alignment of the economy with the needs of the military.
This allows individual industries to be obligated to supply the armed forces.

"An official tender is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously unfilled position," the minister said.
She refused to comment on "speculations by a freedom-loving staff representative."
Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM.
In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was faced with serious bullying allegations.
These have been cleared up, according to Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortners' suitability in terms of content.
He is an expert on World War I and the monarchies' wars, but the institute deals with current questions of security policy.
The SPÖ is demanding clarification from Tanner regarding the "unusual ordering process."
According to SPÖ spokesperson Robert Laimer, there is an appearance of "backroom deals" behind the decision.
The Neos are calling on Tanner to rescind the appointment.
The ÖVP is "still up to their necks in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for defense.
He announced a parliamentary inquiry into the matter.
Carnival: First fools go down on their knees for costs
Thuringia's Carnival hub Wasungen wants to differ from the state capital's traditional Fasching procession.
However, the higher costs, including those for safety, are difficult to handle, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling.
The funds for that alone account for roughly half of the total calculated costs for the parade.
No Carnival parades are being held in Brandenburg.
The "Procession of Happy People" in Cottbus, likely the largest in Eastern Germany, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic.
The Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht is also not canceling any parades.
Schleswig-Holstein's Carnival high point in Marne will maintain its traditional parade despite increased costs.
"We're going ahead with our event," says Heiko Claußen, President of the Carnival Society.
However, financial worries persist: unless more sponsors are found or existing ones contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped "that's not sustainable every year."
The current deficit is around 200,000 euros.
And the inflation:
For sweets, there will be a price increase of up to 60% in some cases, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnacht Association.
Luckily, too much was ordered in 2020, so there is still enough stock this time.
However, the move will still be more expensive.
Twice as much personnel will be needed for safety reasons as in 2020.
Anyone standing along the roadside during the Rose Monday parade in Rhineland could get fewer candies this year than in the past.
Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants won't have as much.
Candy or not, visitor numbers are still expected to be high: "I believe that if it doesn't rain that day, we can expect an increased number of visitors," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne parade leader.
"That's due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rose Monday parade for two years now.
The parade is irreplaceable."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail.
The train is generally "deficient," that's no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Inflicted Vodka
The Ukrainians are not known for their moderation when it comes to drinking.
There's domestic beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv.
I always discover German beer here, but not Kulmbacher, instead other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner.
I can't really taste the difference.
The same goes for vodka, which is widely available.
They distill it themselves, mainly in the villages, and call it Samargon.
Nobody knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics.
The Russian health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had decreased by an incredible 80% in five years.
Well, you can see here how little one can trust the Russians.
It's said that tourists should be careful with it.
But that only applies if they go to mass sales.
Then, it's probably adulterated.

Biathlon World Championships: Federal
President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof.
Federal President
Frank-Walter
Steinmeier and his wife
Elke Büdenbender were greeted by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof.
The German biathletes had no part in the medal distribution at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof.
However, there were two bright spots in the fog.
The Federal President strained himself so much that it was not visible from the honorary tribune on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range were actually falling.
"I had to retrieve the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smirk, and referred to the fog banks that kept rolling into the stadium, greatly impairing the view for the spectators on the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier still enjoyed visiting the 10km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, where he received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, where Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The newly renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions.
The athletes agree with thanks to those who have worked hard here since the World Cup was awarded."
Oberhof is also "a step ahead" of many others in terms of sustainability, ensuring its longevity for "the next years and even decades."
Johannes Thingnes
Bö of Norway once again outskied the competition in a sporty manner.
Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory of the season in 23:21.7 minutes and thereby his second World Cup title in Oberhof.
His error-free shooting brother
Tarjei finished 14.8 seconds behind him, followed by Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) who completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski jumpers were unable to compete for medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph.
Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German with a shooting error and a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes.
WM debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6).
Two bright spots behind the gray veil.
Benedikt
Doll disappointed again, finishing 55th after missing five targets and disappearing disappointed and speechless into the cabin.
Bö started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and maintained this status despite difficult viewing conditions.
However, his last two standing shots were lucky; they landed on the edge of the targets and still fell.
The 29-year-old world champion enjoyed the victory ceremony with his five-year-older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," he said.
"We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday.
The German hopes, however, rest on Herrmann-Wick.
"When you start with the number one, the goal is not to finish tenth.
It's full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said sports director Felix Bitterling, taking his "locomotive" to task.
The organizers expect a sold-out arena for the double event (13:25 and 15:30/ZDF and Eurosport live).

Felix Brych Referee
Felix Brych officiates at referee's ball.
Aggressive players or whining coaches?
Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior.
Referee chief
Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Felix Brych, a top German referee, has noticed negative trends in player behavior on the field.
"I find that there are new behaviors among players that swarm the referee like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency.
"We discussed this during the winter break.
We have decided that we will not accept such unsportsmanlike behavior.
We will pay closer attention to it and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches were also given yellow and red cards.
Mainz coach Bo Svensson was shown a red card during the cup loss against Bayern Munich.
Freiburg coach Christian Streich received a yellow-red card in the league loss in Dortmund.
"Coaching behavior also falls under unsportsmanlike conduct.
We've noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has increased in this area, that the behavior towards referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive.
We also want to consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike behavior," said Brych.
Head of DFB Referees
Lutz
Michael
Fröhlich emphasized a fundamentally good relationship between coaches and referees.
"Overall, the relationship fits.
There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions.
The affected party just has to live with that.
That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during a game.
But if emotions overflow into personal disparagement, then one must also accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," Fröhlich said.
In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared things up after the fact.
"It's important that a change in attitude takes place overall, that such behavior simply doesn't belong," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Sports Journalists Association in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on other levels.
"Naturally, events from professional football always have an impact.
There's a demonstration effect, which leads to imitation.
In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich.
"Regardless of the consistent application of the rules during the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combiner
Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured the victory after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometer cross-country skiing race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter.
Kristjan Ilves from Estonia came in third.
The German combiners are not starting in their best lineup in the Black Forest.
Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not participating.
They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Slovenia's Planica.
"We have three world-class athletes at home.
The team definitely feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven people injured in car accident on A5 Seven people were slightly injured in a multiple vehicle accident on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district) on Saturday, including two children.
According to a police statement, the accident occurred during a minor traffic jam when a driver rear-ended another vehicle, pushing it into two other cars.
The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Closing event at the Marl Sculpture Museum
They have brought the exhibition to life: initiators
Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition comes to an end at the Marl Sculpture Museum.
There will be some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wall-Bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 pm at the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum, located at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
Three exhibition rooms will feature two large-format wall paintings each, drawing attention to themselves.
After the exhibition, the walls will be repainted and the artworks will disappear.
However, a catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum.
It will be presented by the two curators, Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag, on February 12th.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community at the finissage.
Using numerous visual examples, she will present the peculiarities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and explore the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia, during the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who earned her PhD in 2013 with a dissertation on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic.
Since then, she has been researching site-specific art, art and institutional history of post-war Germany, most recently with Sebastian Freytag on art in public spaces in North Rhine-Westphalia.
After the lecture, the final curator-led tour of the exhibition will take place.
The artists are present on site.
"Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey"
It concerns construction defects that have facilitated the collapse of buildings:
In the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey due to building collapses during the earthquake.
According to the state news agency Anadolu, 33 people have been arrested in the city of Diyarbakir, accused of being responsible for building defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, Anadolu reported.
As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said.
One of the suspects was reportedly caught at Istanbul Airport while trying to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu said.
Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
On early Monday morning, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another magnitude 7.6 earthquake at midday.
Over 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former
East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow is dead, the Left faction in the Bundestag announced.
The 95-year-old passed away on Saturday night.
Dietmar Bartsch, chair of the faction, paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday.
The party is losing a significant personality, said fraction chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former fraction chief Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden.
As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR.
Just four days after the fall of the wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR for around 150 days.
The SED/PDS lost power at the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, and Modrow lost his office a month later.
He was followed by the last Prime Minister of the GDR, Lothar de Maizière, a CDU politician, until reunification.
The chairperson of the Left party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short messaging service Twitter as a "deeply genuine and combative socialist."
Bartsch added: He was a highly respected advisor in our party until advanced age, whose wisdom will be greatly missed.
"The peaceful course of German reunification was a special merit of his.
That will be his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary.
His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as Honorary Chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population who did not want to be represented and whose interests were regularly violated.
After reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 for the PDS and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow has viewed the new state "quite critically."
German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR was dissolved too unconditionally, and it was too one-sidedly condemned as an "unjust state," Modrow has criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened at night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian rocket attacks.
Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out repairs to the power grid.
Kiev
The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks has once again forced repairs on the Ukrainian energy grid.
However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions.
Several heat and water power plants have been damaged, said Volodymyr Kudryzkyi, CEO of Ukrenergo, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television.
The situation with electricity supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly dire.
Due to instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnytskyi NPP, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine NPPs.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with approximately 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror.
In a video message, he reported to his fellow countrymen how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris, and Brussels this week.
Zelensky will not leave the small town of Bachmut behind.
On February 24th, a year of war will have passed.
US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary.
The danger of Russian rocket attacks continued into the night on Saturday.
The capital Kiev was put on high alert for the fifth time that day on Friday evening.
"There is a threat of an attack by drones," the Kiev military administration announced.
Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted over the Mykolayiv and Odessa regions in the south and were shot down.
German Rail: Federal government selects consultant for network society Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, to split off during the election campaign failed due to the SPD coalition partner.
In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on a compromise on an infrastructure company that should be oriented towards the common good in the future, which means it will not need to generate profits or distribute them.
80 billion euro renovation backlog
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government navigate this process.
The backlog in rail maintenance is a significant reason why the railways are currently running very late.
Transport Minister
Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem by completely overhauling entire rail corridors.
The investments required for this have been estimated at 50 billion euros so far, but according to the railway's latest calculations, they are more likely to be in the range of 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023
Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had clearly not been in Hermann-Wick's favor.
She had slept poorly, she said after the race, and was "totally excited" with a pulse that refused to slow down even after entering the water.
"Such a race," and at the home World Championships, "it can't be described in words," she said.
11,000 spectators cheered to the thumping pop music, waving German flags, while coaches and team members embraced each other.
"She had decided to enjoy biathlon"
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure was particularly high.
The 34-year-old had started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams.
Herrmann-Wick had won two World Cups this winter, and was currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup standings.
And although the performance density among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, she was not necessarily the favorite for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state.
He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom.
Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018.
At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation sought refuge in churches.
The protests resulted in the deaths of over 350 people in 2018, and thousands of people have left the Central American country in the following years, often fearing reprisals or arrests.
President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
"German military: Arms industry demands more orders from special funds"
First armament projects have already been cancelled, and further plans are threatened with the same fate, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag."
Which investments would be cut specifically cannot be said at present.
"There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential savings requirement at this time," according to a response from the federal government to an inquiry by Member of Parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
Background of the declining investment sum is the rising interest rates.
The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans itself.
As these rise, less money is available for concrete procurements for the Bundeswehr.
Additionally, the high inflation currently reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Copper Cell: Accident with 3
Injured
On Friday night to Saturday (February 10-11), around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway towards Heilbronn at the Kupferzell highway entrance.
At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on road B 19 towards Künzelsau, as reported by the police.
During the BMW driver's turning maneuver, the two vehicles collided.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light at the scene was showing green for them.
An inspection of the traffic light did not reveal any issues.
Further investigations will follow.
The 24-year-old, 21-year-old, and passenger in the BMW were slightly injured and had to be taken to the hospital.
The two cars sustained a total of approximately 20,000 euros in property damage.
Stuttgart
Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria.
The sympathy is great also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world.
More than 200 people gathered on the Stuttgart Palace Square on Friday evening to commemorate the victims and pray for them.
Many community members followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men.
They all listened to the Imam's prayer seriously and silently.
In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could overcome this disaster.
He prayed for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other.
The community also asked for assistance and strength to bring "our aid to the earthquake-stricken areas."
I stand with the people of Turkey and Syria.
The speakers expressed their condolences to the victims' families, who at the time of the memorial service numbered over 22,000.
The prayers were also translated into German on the palace square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great.
The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevite community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in kind on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas.
The willingness to help was overwhelming there as well.
Hike with meat insert Ebersberg "After lunch, you should rest or take a thousand steps"...
The elderly know the proverb, while the young put it into practice.
Thus, during the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance.
For those who, thanks to home office, are not stuck in a concrete desert but are only a stone's throw away from fields, forests, and meadows, use their lunch break either for a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air.
At least that's the impression one could get around Egglburger Lake where dog owners have been busy between 12 and 14 o'clock for quite some time now.
A possible reason could be that modern humans, as part of optimal time management, can combine the health-promoting fresh air intake with other activities.
For example, why not take a short walk through nature and catch up on news from the neighborhood with a long-unseen neighbor?
Or meet up with a friend who you never have time to go to the movies with, not even to the old cinema?
In this way, work and private life could also be combined who says that a meeting with a tax consultant, lawyer, or financial advisor can't take place outdoors?
As long as there are no eavesdroppers around, of course.
One can also excellently acquire natural goods.
Fresh fruit, for example, which stands alongside cheese on a table by the roadside.
Or potatoes and meat.
Only foolish if one has not already thought about the purchase in advance and made the necessary preparations.
Thus, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden salesroom of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voice.
"A shame, we forgot the money."
The disappointment can be felt, as one may have a companion with a wallet, but not a means of transportation.
The friendly chance acquaintance is made aware of this.
The man responds, "That's not true!
You do have a bag!"
He points to the hoodie that one had quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary.
"My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat-filled lunchbox and returns from this midday excursion not only with a leg of lamb, but also with a decidedly practical idea.
It's quite possible that a second walk will be necessary that day after dinner.
This time, actually for digestion.
Trapped and severely injured
At around 9:00 PM, the 25-year-old driver was traveling on the county road towards Hailfingen in his Audi when he suddenly veered off the road to the right for reasons that are still unclear, according to the police report.
The car damaged a guardrail, crashed into a tree, and came to a stop several meters away.
The driver was trapped in the vehicle.
The fire department rescued him using heavy equipment.
The ambulance service transported the seriously injured driver to the hospital.
Since there was suspicion of drunk driving, a blood sample was taken.
The Audi sustained total damage estimated at €1000, according to the police report.
Donald Trump's Tax Returns:
A Matter for the Rule of Law
The US Department of Justice has decided:
The tax authority must hand over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, then still in office as President of the United States.
The Finance Ministry must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
In contrast to political customs in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not publicly release his tax returns either as a candidate or later as president.
He fought against their release all the way to the Supreme Court.
A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details have been made public unless there is a trial.
The release to Congress is likely to be delicate for Trump:
The circle of authorized individuals is larger there, and under certain conditions, specific details could be published during the committee's investigation.
Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, welcomed the decision immediately as a "victory for the rule of law."
Access to the Republican's tax returns is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter.
"The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and the undermining of our security as President," Pelosi explained.

British serious criminal arrested in Thailand after long flight London
A convicted drug criminal from the UK has been arrested in Thailand after five years on the run.
The British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday that the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok.
The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group fled before the start of a trial in early 2018, according to authorities, in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison in absentia for attempting to smuggle amphetamines worth £8 million (€9 million).

Tales from the Big Apple Vince
Ebert has a mission:
The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and claims to love the Viennese sense of humor, is using his cabaret programs to champion science.
The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again," fits in well with this mission.
Whether this approach will work in the current climate of widespread scientific skepticism remains to be seen.
However, his humor is certainly well-suited to Vienna.
The English title is also derived from Ebert's younger life story, as he attempted to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019.
Now he's back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences overseas, but also explains what science fiction actually is and what it can and cannot do.
Of course, Corona also comes up, as well as German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering ingenuity.
And he boils it down to the most important question that many people push aside:

General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor.
This game depicts the battle scene from the perspective of a tank driver.
The battles take place in a wide valley surrounded by mountains and volcanoes.
In the valley, there are rock pyramids and rock blocks that provide temporary shelter for the player, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile rockets that become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay.
Additionally, UFOs appear periodically.
These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO.
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes.
These are the attraction mode, the game introduction mode, the game play mode, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test mode.
The latter mode represents a special sequence for testing the control elements and computer functions.
Gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated.
The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible.
The game ends when the last player's tank is eliminated by the enemy.
The game begins with slow-moving tanks that are visible on the screen.
The player can determine the position of the enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left corner of their cockpit's hint display.
For example, a hint might read:
ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT.
Additionally, a point appears on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, indicating the enemy's position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the lower screen.
If the enemy is within this area, they are easily visible on the screen.
Additionally, "ENEMY IN FIRE ZONE" is displayed simultaneously in the upper left hint display.
Occasionally, UFOs will appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield.
These are harmless drones that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank.
The UFOs' flight path cannot be detected by radar.
They are intended to add variety to the gameplay and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles.
UFOs can be eliminated by either the player's tank or the enemy tank.
Shooting down a UFO earns the player 5,000 points.
If an enemy is hit, the following points are awarded: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super-tank.
A super-tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy slow-moving tank.
The game's design allows for different possibilities, enabling the player to use 2, 3 ,4 ,or even 5 tanks.
Additionally ,upon reaching certain point thresholds ,a bonus tank can be unlocked,and appearance of missile can varied for more challenging gameplay experience.
The exact details and positions of gameplay selection switch of these options can be found in image.
Initial input at highest levels
"If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of high scores, they can enter three (3) personal initials after the game ends.
The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages.
Note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply will delete the high score table.
When resetting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are retained and redisplayed on the screen to challenge other players.
Each score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials.
If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically enter dashes.
Afterward, the device will switch back to the attract mode."
New parts
The BATTLEZONE device features five (5) new components.
If you have experience with ATARI video games, you should take note of these important differences.
The new components are:A.
The control lever.
This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever.
It has been reinforced with additional ribs on the inner and outer housing parts, ensuring stability and proper functioning of the switch contacts.
An additional centering balloon made of rubber, which acts as a centering spring, returns the control lever to its default position.
The micro-switches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement.B. Two PC boards.
ATARI's X/Y game circuitry has been expanded onto two interconnected boards.
These are the Analog Vector Generator board and the Auxiliary board.
With the help of these advanced switching techniques, more lines are displayed on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and stable image.C.
The power supply.
Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply unit which features a larger, more powerful transformer to cover increased energy requirements resulting from expansion of circuitry.D.
The device housing:
Due to its new design it was possible to install a new coin box with enlarged capacity for coins.
Moreover there is console integrated in this machine that was designed for shorter players; facilitating gameplay,while simultaneously guaranteeing maximum machine stability at point of set up.
The new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are depicted in Image 1.
If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol.
2. Device inspection.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play.
However, it is still recommended to perform a quality control check to ensure that the device was delivered in good condition.
To confirm that the device is in proper working order, the following checks should be performed:
NOTE:
Do not connect the device to the 220 V power grid yet.
A. Inspect the exterior of the housing for damage.
B. Open the maintenance hatch of the device and check the components inside as follows:
(1) Check all cable connectors for proper and secure connection.
Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never forcibly establish connector connections.
The connectors are equipped with a locking mechanism that ensures a correct connection.
An inverted connector connection (rotated 180 degrees) will damage the PCB.
(2)
Check the power connector connections to the game console motherboard are proper and secure.
(3)
Check the serial number on the device's rear panel.
Make sure the stamped serial number matches the serial numbers of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, Auxiliary PCB, Regulator/Audio II PCB, and TV monitor.
A diagram of the serial number's location is on the back page of this manual.
Always provide this number when calling your dealer for further service information.
(4)
Check all other major components, such as the power supply, control panel, and TV monitor, for proper installation.
(5)
Finally, the device must be powered by a network connection and turned on.
Through the player's viewing glass, check that the radar screen is located in the bright, orange-rimmed opening of  housing.
If opening is not centered,the housing's cover which is secured with adhesive tape ,must be loosened and repositioned.
Before connecting device to power supply , make sure voltage selector switch on power supply(see Fig .3 ) matches local voltage.
Check cable color and controls values follows:
DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE?
Here are some tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games.
Checking the system configuration...
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging.
You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Program to get an overview of your system's capabilities if you're not sure if it meets the requirements.
To run the DirectX Diagnostic Program, follow these steps: Click the "Start" button and select "Run."
Type "dxdiag" in the text field.
The DirectX Diagnostic Program's user interface will be displayed, providing you with access to all relevant system information, including details about your graphics and sound card.
You can check if your graphics and sound are functioning properly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound.
Note: If you don't have advanced computer knowledge, we advise against modifying any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Program.
Before starting the game,.
It is possible that other programs may take up system resources that the game needs to run smoothly.
Not all of these programs are necessarily obvious and many will start automatically when the system boots up.
Such programs that are constantly running in the background are referred to as "background applications."
In some cases, they can cause the game to hang or crash.
Therefore, we recommend closing or disabling such background applications before starting the game.
If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or deactivate them before starting the game.
To do this, locate the program's icon in the Windows taskbar and right-click on it, then select the appropriate option ("Deactivate," "Close," or similar).
Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close other unnecessary background applications, as they can sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game.
You can read more about how to end all unnecessary background applications in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications."
Clean up your system.
Before installing software, it is essential to ensure that your hard drive is functioning optimally.
You should therefore make it a habit to regularly clean up your PC.
The tools you need for this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to ensure that everything runs smoothly.
Then the chances are high that current games will run problem-free on your PC.
A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, which means that other applications you use will also run faster and more stable.
Consult the Windows help files to learn more about the tools ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation, and disk cleanup.
Using the Windows help Click on the "Start" button and select "Help" (or "Help and Support") to open the Windows Help.
2.
Click in the search field and enter the appropriate keyword, for example, "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup".
You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
When playing games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should ensure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.
This can often prevent the game from crashing or freezing.
First, try downloading the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website.
Here are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ON FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked in me by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a wealth of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, allowing me to push the boundaries of the world.
I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still-developing technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still so much to discover especially a new language that was both narrative and visual.
To be honest, the next ten years didn't satisfy my hunger.
I had the nagging feeling that video games were only utilizing a tiny part of their incredible creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental aspect of human experience: emotions.
Meanwhile, technology continued to advance at a rapid pace.
Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that can convey emotions.
Even if it could have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest achievement is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers.
Fahrenheit is proof that one can create an interactive experience that is not based solely on fighting monsters in dark corridors and searching for ammunition on crates, but rather offers more complex and deeper content.
It is proof that one can both tell a story and offer gameplay without sacrificing either narrative or interactive elements.
I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience.
If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will change your mind.
May other developers also feel inspired to follow this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent, and ambition.
The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers...

This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player.
The value ranges from 1 to 99 and should not be set too close to 99 so that the credits do not become zero when a coin is inserted.
A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum number of credits" to 0.

With the help of this display, the operator can select a standard coin setting or program a different setting.
"If a standard setting is provided, pressing the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons will select the programming, while the top number on the screen will light up green.
The values will change with the change of the digit.
When the correct setting is reached by pressing the 'Test' button, the setting will be adopted.
If a setting is desired that does not match the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing  'Sub-Test' button.
After a single press, top setting number will be set to 0 which means that own settings are possible.
Since lower values remain unchanged, programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setup close to his desired value and only changing not suitable ones.

When "Memory Failure Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed.
All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default settings.
This condition likely indicates a battery failure or malfunction.
Troubleshooting and settings
Beginning of the test procedure.
Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display).
All LEDs should light up, and the hardware test can begin.
The tests and settings can be entered for each program display by pressing the "Test" switch, which will display the next program.
If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice, which will start the video test in auto-test mode.
In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is turned off.
When the display shows "Open Coin Door to Test" (Coin door open for testing), the program plug J 19, 1-2 must be inserted.
With J 19 plug removed, memory (RAM) is protected and CMOS RAM Video Test cannot be performed.
Hardware tests:
These tests are executed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = Test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the stored checksum for that ROM.
If a difference is found, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs.
If the ROM checksum is faulty, "U 10" is displayed first.
If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED-Display must be replaced.
The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs.
The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732).
Communications RAM from the video board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct.
LED value: 00 0010
If the result matches the displayed value, an error has been detected.
If the Communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or a fault on the Data Board.
To locate the error, remove Data Board at P 6 and repeat test.
A failure indicates an error in U 3, U 4, or associated circuitry.
Video Board
Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
Random Access Memory
After values have been written to another part of memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM.
If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous values.
LED value: 00 0011
If the device holds the aforementioned display, an error has occurred.
In this case, check U85 and U86 and the associated circuitry or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM.
These numbers will be checked for accuracy when read back.
LED value: 00 0100
If this value is displayed, an error has occurred.
Check U56, U57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
The video display (advertisement RAM) is checked by writing a pattern on each page.
The results of these write operations are compared to the original pattern.
Any discrepancy brings the program to a halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM.
If a display RAM fails, the problem is identified and the RAM is replaced.
If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is displayed that the next test will begin (Data Hardware).
The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with Amazon logistics.
That's also the reason for the first star.
The second star is because the correct jacket arrived without visible sewing defects.
However, I had looked forward to this jacket too much, so the disappointment was all the greater.
I had oriented myself based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L.
Since it's supposed to fit snugly and I didn't want to struggle with a S or M,...
In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and waist...but the rest was too loose.
Additionally, the lining material came loose as soon as I opened the package and spread everywhere.
Just a shame...it's being returned :/ Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression.
We were surprised by its good workmanship.
It can be worn on both sides.
We ordered it for our daughter, she's totally thrilled.
She usually wears size 158 and size 36 fits her well in this case and will likely be worn for the next year as well.
We can recommend placing an order.
Robust Quality
I decided on the rubber mat C because I always work with wood on the tail lift and that's not optimal.
Unfortunately, I measured wrong and the mat doesn't fit quite right.
That's my mistake.
I made some slight adjustments so it fits now.
The mat seems very sturdy and the edges don't get damaged anymore.
You can use the studs or the entire surface.
Worked without any problems.
Nothing slips anymore.
I would buy it again right away.
Unfortunately, too large for under 1 year.
The product itself is okay, but not for a child under a year old.
The surface area is too large for a small mouth.
We bought it for our son when he was 7 months old, but he couldn't use it due to its size.
Now that he's 12 months old, we've tried it again and he can use it.
He still hasn't been able to bite down on it with his few teeth, but it does help to soothe him when he's in the refrigerator.
"Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, it's going back"
I was blinded by the partially overwhelming reviews here.
I would like to preface that I already have two Lowepro backpacks in use.
A large one for storing equipment and a smaller one for everyday essentials.
However, since I recently purchased the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has become too small, and I need a replacement.
I bought this backpack for a very reasonable price (just under 29 EUR) during Prime Day and was initially very pleased with my purchase, having read many of the reviews beforehand.
However, when the backpack arrived yesterday, I was disappointed: while it's not bad for under 30 EUR, it's simply not comparable to the high-quality products that are sold at much higher prices.
The padded walls are much thinner and don't offer the same level of protection as my Lowepro.
The inner compartments are also of a different caliber, much cheaper.
Overall, the haptics of this backpack are not comparable to my Lowepro.
The zippers and materials used for the small item compartments are also not particularly high-quality.
Therefore, I have decided to return the backpack.
If I'm investing in equipment worth thousands of euros, I unfortunately have to spend money on a reasonable backpack as well.
Quality does seem to have its price here apparently though..
For someone who doesn't want to spend much money; this backpack is probably a good choice; but not for me..
And it wasn't difficult decision for me..
As soon as i unpacked it ,I knew within two minutes it's going back,.
One thing i did like was bright color inside Backpack .
wouldn't take long finding your things with Light interior than gray ones perhaps...
If someone ha different requirements from back pack its Great!
But mine is definitely going back!
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part.
I had previously enjoyed the Electric series by E. L.
Todd the most, but my opinion was revised with this book.
I found the first two books very strong and recommendable, and I was really looking forward to the third part.
However, the whole time in this part is spent on Volt and Taylor's feelings, and I found it unnecessary and drawn out.
Taylor has been swooning over Volt for so long, finally admits everything, and then acts like a child during every argument and gets upset?!
At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt had tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would stand by him and tried to convince him that Taylor couldn't do without him and he had heard it himself.
But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor.
I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series-editorial-reviewBodyI think that this parts are placed on par with each other unnecessarily so far as they are weaker than necessary as well..
Still reading through them with ease though trying not get scammed by any lackluster reviews assuring me things will improve in short order!

First of all, the film is not as bad as many people say.
Of course, the story is completely fabricated and follows the same formula over and over again.
If you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends.
And the message is always the same: humanity destroys everything and doesn't appreciate it, and doesn't learn from it!
And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us!
I've thought to myself while watching the film (and I know it's just a movie and the animals are computer-generated) :
Oh my god, the poor animals, it's heartbreaking.
Jurassic World:
Fallen
Kingdom is well-made.
It's a shame that humanity doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie.
We destroy consequently, the animals and the environment, and finally our planet and ourselves.
Out of greed for gainprFitlinesssidityupRose zero 4 stars because tht still follows popcorn cinema
A quiet, sensitive film.
Some people expect a film like 8 Mile here.
This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be either.
This film is primarily "French" besides, it's calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and brings tears to your eyes if you let yourself be moved by it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like
Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter.
5 packets every morning: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing.
My waistline has grown by 12 cm!
Unprecedented bloating!
Diarrhea
5-8 times a day.
Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for a week now.
It's worth noting that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately not noticed until too late), while the larger size received a full 5 stars.
That's very strange!
"Terrible smell and poor results!
I dyed my blonde hair a deep brown in October using a hair dye remover in February/March.
I applied the product twice.
The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled horrible!
However, the result was not too bad, it came out a dark chestnut brown (a bit darker).
Since I didn't get the desired result, I used it again, as instructed, for unsatisfactory results.
This time, it was a complete waste of time!
It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first try.
The worst part was that it still smelled terrible weeks after application, no matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away."
Highly Recommended
I've been taking the tablets for a longer period of time now, one tablet every 5 days.
My vitamin levels had been in the basement for a while due to my job, lack of exercise, and an additional illness.
I wanted to give my immune system a boost not only through a healthy diet but also through the intake of vitamin D3 and K2.
This has been working out very well.
I feel fitter and significantly better.
I sleep better and wake up feeling better.
The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets.
Absolutely recommendable.
Function not entirely flawless !!!
After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major flaws that I find very annoying:
1) The case has problems connecting to the phone over time.
This means that it no longer charges even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds.
Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new issue.
2) The frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone has caused the lid to become so worn out that it detaches from the case on its own, which is why I have almost lost it several times.
While these may not be major flaws, I believe that a battery case should function flawlessly in its intended use, especially for a price of 30€.
Therefore, I am very disappointed with the product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months..
"Too expensive, too thin, and disappointing"
I don't know how these good reviews came about.
Ultimately, it's just a microfiber cloth that you can get in a smaller size as a free gift at any optician's.
The cleaning effect is just as good as a dish towel and not better.
I had expected much more from these cloths, but they are also very, very thin.
Since I've used it, I can't exchange it, and I can't recommend it from my side.
The price for these cloths is way too high, more than 2 euros would be too much.
I doubt the frequency range.
I purchased this speaker for the shower as my smaller free promotional speaker, which I received as a gift, unfortunately broke.
The Onforu works great overall, is waterproof (I accidentally dropped it in the shower), provides good bass, and the Bluetooth function works well...
The suction cup must be moistened, otherwise it won't stick.
It can produce very loud sound...
yes... what I do find critical is the frequency response of this small speaker.
As mentioned, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency.
However, this causes a problem.
Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet.
While some frequencies of the vocals are almost deafening, higher and lower frequencies are barely audible.
My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well, but the frequencies were represented in a fairly natural volume.
Unfortunately, that's not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying.
Therefore, I have to deduct a star.
I expected more from the frequency response.. very bad
At a few spots, the color had peeled off and when you just walked over it with your hand, the color would also come off at other spots.
We wanted to have them picked up for free because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our own expense.
They would only exchange the damaged parts, but if both commodes were damaged.
Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has taken care of everything for us and refunded our money.
A LOB to Amazon.
"Spend a little more money"
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality.
Individual parts are delivered that you have to glue together yourself.
The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard, without any additional protection.
The postman stuffed the product into my mailbox, which caused a few templates to be damaged.
I didn't complain, as I needed this product urgently.
The adhesive provided does not hold well, but it sticks nicely like chewing gum that doesn't harden.
Almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick within a day of gluing.
Since the adhesive material did not dry (at least it was still not dry after 5 days), you have to be careful not to get everything stuck together.
The templates are partially incomplete.
For a one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied.
The wardrobe looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear.
+ Magnetic closure + beautiful optics + stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned arbitrarily.
Doors slam shut with magnets (maybe can be adjusted with rubber bumps) some unsightly spots.
The delivered dowels are much too small and wobbly (I didn't have any others and had to use glue to attach them) the fittings for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped them in paper and adjusted them)
Summary: If it didn't look so good and didn't have such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit properly to be really satisfied.
Additionally, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me...but There are only three stars.
The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive).
Therefore, I would have given 5 stars.
Unfortunately, the coffee does not run smoothly (if at all!).
The additional plastic waste (individually packaged, see photo) also means a star deduction for me.
I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets a full score soon.
"Geht mir auf den Wecker" translates to "It gets on my nerves."
The alarm clock came quickly and everything was easy to set up.
However, the natural sounds were terrifying and extremely loud.
I couldn't make them any quieter either.
Apparently, it's possible that it's a defect.
The radio setting was also too loud for me, and I would immediately wake up whenever I turned it on.
Additionally, the darkest display setting was so bright that I could cast a shadow on the wall with my hand.
I would always wake up whenever I turned my face towards the alarm clock, thinking it was already morning.
When the sunrise simulation finally began, it was immediately too bright for me.
I found the colors and color changes beautiful, but unfortunately, the colored light cannot be dimmed.
I also liked that it has a battery, so that the clock and alarm time don't need to be reset during a power outage.
However, I returned it for the reasons mentioned above.
"Light super, processing unsatisfactory"
I have replaced four light fixtures in my home with these lamps.
Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a base instead, a circuit board laughs at me at that spot...
There was also nothing in the box.
"6 pay 4 receive" is not a good deal.
Amazon would have certainly taken care of it quickly and easily, but I only noticed it after the return period.
Therefore, I see it as my mistake and live with it.
However, it's not a good indicator of the quality of these light fixtures the only reason for deducting two stars.
The light itself is great.
The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit.
The light color tends towards cool white.
Perfect for hallways, home offices, workshops, laundry rooms, etc.
For living rooms, I would personally prefer warmer lighting.
Other lamps can also provide that, and maybe I'll get intact examples corresponding to my order.
I hope my review helps.
I'll answer questions quickly.
Great!
I have received the utensils and I would like to share my first impression.
Yes, positively.
I have thought about ordering this set for a long time, and I'm glad I did.
The material is stable and feels good in the hand.
The utensils have a hole at the handle for easy hanging, which is practical.
The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware or pots and is especially useful for pans with a non-stick coating.
They are heat-resistant up to 440°F and do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly.
However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone, but they can be easily wiped away.
Overall, I am very surprised and can only recommend them.
"B-Ware sold as new"or"B-Ware passed off as new"
Amazon Prime delivery top-notch.
Delivery within 24 hours.
Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.
We found that the part had already been assembled.
All mounting parts had significant scratches and scuffs.
The hose connections were all damaged.
Despite this, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately).
Only now did we notice that there were also scratches and streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself.
This part was probably delivered and returned before.
We'll keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn't matter how it looks.
Our verdict: never again will we order such goods from Amazon, but will give a little more at the hardware store where we get decent quality.
It's just sad that customers are treated this way!!!
Product excellent, outdoor sensor unfortunately defective after 6 months.
I am generally very satisfied with this product.
The installation was very easy, and the range is also very good, with no problems transferring data from inside to outside.
I also find the design of the device appealing.
It's very simple and can be mounted on the wall or placed like a small picture frame.
The only drawback is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures values outside seems to have broken down.
The thermometer still works fine and displays plausible values, but the hygrometer is defective, showing completely implausible values for outside humidity.
This is a shame, as the device was installed in a protected location, which is why I can only give it two stars.
Strong mower with weak catcher
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt by Hermes is still driving around the republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon was excellent as always, triggering a replacement delivery.
The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression.
The motor is strong and produces a beautiful cutting result.
The noise level is not particularly low, but okay.
The major drawback is the collection bag.
On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic on top and bottom, and fabric in between.
If you set it down briefly, it will naturally get crushed and parts of the contents will fall out.
Worse still, the practical fill-level indicator shows red even when the bag is only half full.

Good surveillance equipment I have two of these devices.
The device can be easily integrated via the app.
The included detachable sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary.
The device is solidly built.
The room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once or thrice a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery.
For these reasons, I'll give it 4 stars.
The soft back panel of the device, which also covers the battery compartment, can only be closed fiddly.
One of the two devices is in a room with thick walls.
This device loses its network connection every 1-2 weeks.
Unfortunately, it doesn't reconnect automatically even when placed near the router.
One has to remove the batteries, wait for a short while, and then reinsert them for it to reconnect.
It should be able to reconnect without removing the batteries.
There's always an alarm when the connection is lost.
The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer
I ordered this 3D printer to use for my own projects, but unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed properly.
The rear right fixing screw is completely tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high and the screw falls out easily, even though it's not tightened at all.
The rods that hold the carriage are straight and the table is also level.
Maybe someone knows what to do about this, because it's impossible to print anything like this.
The assembly was relatively problem-free, but it would be helpful to show how to route the cables properly to avoid having to reconnect them multiple times, which is very tedious.
I have already contacted support, but after a week of waiting, I still haven't received a response.
Unfortunately, returning the printer is no longer an option.
I had expected more.
Robust and precise, I am positively surprised.
My old measuring tape has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one.
This one here makes a very robust impression and has proven to be just as precise after several test measurements.
It comes with two batteries, so it's ready to use right out of the box.
The packaging of the measuring tape is simple but fully serves its purpose.
The measuring tape itself leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods.
I can only give it top marks and believe it will last at least as long as the old one.
I highly recommend it and think a good measuring tape belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell.
I bought the armband and didn't wear it for a while because it emitted a disgusting smell.
Despite being aired out constantly, the smell has not gone away.
Since returning it was no longer an option, I disposed of it.
I would advise against purchasing it.
Okay for the price.
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too large for my taste, so it looks quite bulky.
The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice.
However, the chain itself is very simply made, so I've managed to open the clasp twice already.
I've been able to repair it each time, but I don't think that will last long.
Given the low price, you can't really expect anything of high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry.
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually works!
You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!
I've rubbed it with some leather conditioner, which makes it softer and more supple.
However: anyone with a magnetic field near their arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk!
I was already disappointed after unpacking, since the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, giving me the feeling that it was used goods.
The base station was fine.
Now to the function:
Connects only after some fidgeting...
if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it back did the transmitters finally connect.
Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long because after an hour the connection was lost again, even though transmitters were right next to the base station.
Moreover, readings from three transmitters varied greatly!
In conclusion, this device is unusable for me!
It went back right away!
I would definitely advise against purchasing this product as it will only cause trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft had rusted after 3.5 years.
I only bought it again because I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction hose and the discharge would fit.
I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production defect and the new pump will last longer.
Unfortunately, the new pump had a shipping damage, the plastic housing was torn and the air vents were broken.
The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump better in its future use, not just using a thin cardboard box.
I still kept them because as mentioned above that they were urgent loan requirements and for some reason even with cracks in its plastic housing did not impair pumping performance.
"I should have thought it through better.
Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought an organizer would be more convenient than walking around with a huge key ring.
At first, everything went well.
However, the paint quickly wore off and the screws had to be tightened constantly.
It's nice that it can also be opened with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin.
I couldn't find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the whole screw.
Now, the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys.
It's nice that you can adjust the screws to different sizes and lengths, but you need pliers to take it apart again after it's been screwed together.
Attaching the keys is simply a game of patience, balance, and dexterity.
Finally, on the third attempt, the screw broke off in the thread and the whole thing became unusable.
Verdict: If you really need to carry a lot of keys, it's better to buy a cheaper alternative."
Do not quite match the specified dimensions.
Easy-to-use zippers, the material feels robust, and everything is lightweight.
Since I have no comparison (this is my first set of organizers), I'll only be able to truly evaluate the product after its first use.
However, I can already say that the height is lower than advertised.
At the moment, I can't quite imagine fitting everything for a three-week trip in there.
The really big items will have to go directly into the suitcase just like before.
It's worth noting that 10 parts were delivered instead of 8, as there were two small pouches/bags included in the round cosmetics bag.
The cosmetics bag has a different color and material than the other bags, but that doesn't bother me personally.
I consider the price-performance ratio to be acceptable, and that's okay.
"So lala" translates to "So silly" or "So foolish" in English.
"I had ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas.
Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore.
Battery?
Replaced.
But it still doesn't work.
I could have just thrown the money directly into the trash."
Care is always good!
The application is simple, but one should be very careful when approaching the brush to not damage the needle.
I could not discern any improvement in sound from my very high quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected.
Two black cables were included.
The battery life is plenty long.
Definitely completely satisfactory sound.
I liked that the headphones do not hurt after long wear and are therefore very comfortable.
The ear cushions are totally soft and pleasant to wear.
The weight is also very low.
Recommendation to buy in this price range.
Chic dress
Very nice dress that is versatile for various occasions.
The price-performance ratio is spot on, especially since I got it on a flash sale.
It fits me perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it a size smaller (as recommended).
I would have liked the neckline to be slightly higher and the sleeves to have a bit more fabric (if you don't have as slender upper arms as the model in the picture).
But overall, a stylish dress for many occasions.
"Hands off.
It doesn't get any worse than this.
I really and seriously did not expect that such junk would be sold these days.
The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop.
It is assumed that the USB ports provide enough power.
Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible.
DVDs work normally, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at best.
The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which they make grinding noises like those heard from old PCs and the first CD-ROM drives from the 90s.
After a few minutes, the computer can either be restarted because it freezes or the disc is finally recognized.
But you can't press pause, skip to a chapter, change the language, or do anything else during the movie.
That immediately leads to an unfixable freeze.
Additionally, there is no Blu-ray software included.
If you purchase PowerDVD or similar software separately, the price of this drive doubles."
"It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not very pretty.
First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually just for show, since only the port that faces upwards is a real USB port.
The other plug is only there for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless.
I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed.
I actually needed a second port and would have been better off with a simple extension cord, rather than this bulky, gold-plated thing.
But aside from its appearance and my misjudgment, the extension cord does its job very reliably.
And thanks to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't dangle around easily, like it would with a normal extension cord.
So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is limited."
"Small but oh!
I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display.
With iOS 12, you can now transfer data back and forth.
This works very well.
The audio output was as expected.
Other adapters that I had to return unfortunately couldn't do this.
The HDMI output is practical.
I now have a PS4 controller connected wirelessly to the tablet and the HDMI to the TV.
Simultaneous charging is no problem.
The sound is delivered through HDMI.
What do I still need my PlayStation for? 😅
There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet.
It provides stability and has a magnetic holder.
However, it doesn't fit with my case and the adapter.
Oh well, it still holds securely and has contact...
All in all, it's a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions.
Plus, it's very small and made of aluminum, which makes it stable.
The price-performance ratio is appropriate."
A lot of performance.
Top device.
Has been running without problems for months.
It's not particularly light or quiet, but it delivers decent performance.
I find the medium temperature setting (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2.
It has already fallen onto the floor several times and has survived well.
And I also like the simple design.
Competitor products often look like spaceships.
Very good.
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, despite the large price difference compared to the original, which does not make a cheap impression.
In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed.
Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can recommend them without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised by its accuracy in real-time mode, which feels like 0.5 meters.
However, when the dog is indoors, it sometimes jumps a few meters, which is not disturbing.
I would buy it again anytime.
What would be great, though, is a battery that lasts longer.
Currently, it lasts for about 1.5 days, and a solution that could last 7-14 days would be super.
There is an XL version available, but unfortunately, it's too big for our taste, and we wouldn't want to have to change the battery every day.
We want to spend time with our dog, not with its collar.
The app worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, trash.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes.
They fit well and seem comfortable.
However, their lifespan is decreasing significantly.
Even though my son only wears them for gym class, the soles are already worn out after just a few weeks, and the shoes cannot be used anymore.
The same thing happened with the previous pair, even though I thought they would last longer under normal use.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.
The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly but original?
My last pair of Crocs finally broke after five years, so I was delighted to order a new pair.
Unfortunately, these ones seem poorly made at first glance.
They're just as comfortable as my previous pair, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel is loose and unlikely to last five years like my previous pair.
I'm curious to see how they'll hold up!
Surprisingly good
Here's the translation of the text from German to English:I was initially skeptical since there were hardly any reviews available.
However, since I'm attending a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I decided to give it a try.
The package included a mattress and a portable air pump.
Regarding the mattress, I laid it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo) and noticed some mold on one side.
I wiped it off and hope it doesn't come back.
Once inflated, I conducted a lying test and it was very comfortable.
It's not a replacement for my own bed, but it's pure luxury for a few days at the festival.
The mattress fits perfectly in my car, especially after removing the rear seats.
The air pump has multiple adapters, and the mattress requires two different ones, which are also included.
The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter, but the connector was defective (something wrong with welding).
Luckily, my friend is handy and was able to repair it; after that worked excellently inflating the mattress in no time.
Overall, I'm very pleased with this product!
Awaiting eagerly for its durability test at festival hoping that It won't leak air over time & last longer & moreover does not have mold regrowth .
Based on initial experience can definitely recommend same
If there happen to be an update(alternative learning) during use would definitely make sure Update review(if acceptable).
Definitely not worth more than 10€...
Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars.
1. For the quick shipping.
2. For the idea of the toy.
Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open on day one, directly through several doors.
On the 21st door, there were no doors left, and I had to allow my son to remove the remaining parts since they were already falling out.
The parts often come loose during play, which means you have to disassemble the car again to put them back on.
After the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play (the front windshield is the most common one to fall off).
I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Maybe manufacturers will reconsider how they design their next edition's calendar and make it better :\. a real drone I am thrilled with the drone.
My 7-year-old daughter flies it.
It flies very well indoors and the 5-minute flight time is usually enough.
I didn't expect anything else at this price, but hair getting tangled in it and the drone breaking quickly didn't surprise me.
Crashes from the ceiling to the ground, whether on tiles or carpet, are no problem.
Friendly contact for questions.
"Game okay but only playable with forced Steam connection.
I didn't realize when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD but just a code to download the game.
That would be fine, but you're forced to install Steam just to play it, which is outrageous.
Since then, my computer has been constantly crashing, which wouldn't be the case with a clean installation of the game."
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the watch.
The design and appearance were great, and the notifications worked flawlessly.
The user interface was also good... but I'm still returning it.
The big drawbacks: the battery and its runtime.
Fully charged in the evening, left on the dresser overnight, and in the morning, there were 11% fewer battery bars without any usage.
If I received a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already dead by midday or early afternoon, and I couldn't even read the time anymore.
Therefore, it's not usable for me.
Very disappointing.
Noble shell with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it's definitely worth getting a case.
I've recently come across cases that allow you to store your credit card, and this one has three card slots.
However, if you fill all three slots, the lid will be a bit bulky.
One card is enough for me.
The leather case makes a robust impression and seems well-made.
It looks elegant.
The phone is embedded in the case all around, except for the connections, which have cutouts.
The volume controls and power button can be easily operated through the case.
Unfortunately, it's not possible to charge the phone wirelessly on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case.
Even the leather QI charging station from TORRO doesn't work.
Therefore, you can only charge accessories like the Galaxy Buds when the case is removed.
Otherwise, it's a stylish and well-made case!
High-quality case with armor glass film.
Robust case with a genuine armored glass screen protector provides all-around protection for the iPhone 11 in a classic design.
Fits well and can be easily put on.
The material is pleasant to the touch and doesn't get dirty.
A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio.
This case gives the phone a good grip.
It's not too bulky and stays firmly attached to the phone.
Overall, a good purchase.
