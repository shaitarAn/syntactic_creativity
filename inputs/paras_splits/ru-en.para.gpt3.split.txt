The endless sound of the sea never ceased for a moment.
It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes fading away.
The wind would start to rustle in the bare trees, then die down, just like me, listening to the flow of the night.
But it didn't go away, it was still here.
I could tell by the smell of wet gravel and the barely audible quiver of a solitary plane leaf.
I had noticed this stubborn grey leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed to me like a small living creature, my only wakeful friend.
Occasionally, from the darkness, from the city, gunshots could be heard.
After each shot, dogs would howl for a long time.
Then, far out at sea, a faint fire would flicker and go out.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover many qualities in them that had not been noticed before.
For example, in the rough yellow stone there were many tiny sea shells embedded in it; on the bushes of broom there were still a few flowers, sitting on straight, firm stalks like wet, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
But it rarely shone through the hazy white patch of mist, giving neither warmth nor shade.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon-coloured spots on its trunk, the leaves lay scattered like pieces cut from a dull green velvet.
A line of ants ran along the iron gate, carrying off to their underground storehouses the last supplies for winter, and under the anchor chain lived a small, timid toad.
At night, on the other side of the river, someone started to wave a flashlight and shout in a drawn-out voice.
My uncle Ilko and I went out to the bank.
The river was roaring.
The water was flowing through the rapids in a cold waterfall.
It was a late, silent night, not a single star in the sky.
The wild freshness of the melted earth blew in our faces.
And all the time someone was waving a flashlight and shouting on the other side of the river, but the words could not be distinguished over the noise of the river.
When the coffin was carried out onto the porch, I saw on the other side of the river an old carriage, horses harnessed and tied to it, and a small woman in black—the mother.
She stood motionless on the shore.
From there she saw her father being carried away.
Then she knelt down and fell face first onto the sand.
"No," Grandpa replied.
"That's true, they hadn't seen each other.
Ostop had started to go blind.
He had decided to go to St. Petersburg at that time to see the same woman before he went completely blind.
He made it to the imperial capital and found out that she had died—perhaps she couldn't bear the separation.
Ostop found her grave of white marble and when he looked, his heart broke—there lay his iron rose.
The woman had bequeathed that a rose be placed on her grave forever.
And Ostop began to sing and, perhaps, died on the way or at the market under the wagon.
Amen!
On the opposite bank rose the forest of the Countess Branitskaya.
The sun could not penetrate the thick foliage of this forest.
Only occasionally a solitary ray would cut through the thicket and reveal to us the astonishing power of vegetation.
Like sparkling dust motes, small birds would fly into this ray.
They would chirp and chase each other and dive into the foliage, as if into green water.
I would scoop water from the pond, throw in some grass and wait.
The red floats would stand motionless in the water.
Then one of them would start to quiver, make small circles, suddenly dive or quickly swim away.
My father would set the hook, the line would tighten, the walnut rod would bend into an arc, and a bubbling, splashing and commotion would begin over the pond.
The water would ripple, little buckets would be hurriedly paddled away in all directions, and finally a mysterious golden glint would appear in the depths.
It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out onto the grassy bank a heavy carp, gasping for breath.
It lay on its side, flapping its fins.
An amazing smell of the underwater kingdom emanated from its scales.
Yasha counted the seconds in his head.
We knew that it was a seven-minute walk from Sturdzovskiy Lane to the Landsman Sanatorium.
Behind the high fence and iron gates of the sanatorium we always felt completely safe, especially if we didn't light any bonfires.
When we passed by the alleyway, Yasha stumbled.
Later, when we remembered the incident in Sturdzovskiy Lane, Yasha insisted that if you wanted to do something the best way, you always had to trip up on something insignificant.
But I thought to myself that it was all due to Yasha's unbearable gait.
But I kept quiet so as not to upset Yasha.
We crept along the alley.
I said we should go on the side of the gateway, stopping short of it, and listen carefully, then quickly and silently pass by the gateway.
My calculation, it seemed to me, was mathematically precise.
If there were people in the gateway, they might not notice us.
But if we went on the opposite side of the gateway, we might be seen from a distance.
I calculated that in the latter case we would be walking towards the dangerous gateway, or rather, we would be visible to the people hiding in the gateway five times longer.
And, consequently, there would be five times more chances that we would be noticed.
In the morning I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls.
Red and yellow monkshoods swayed at the open window.
With them peeping into the room was a nasturtium flower; a furry bee was sitting in it.
I, motionless, watched as it angrily buzzed and made its way out of the tight flower.
On the ceiling ran endless streams of light, gentle waves—reflections of the river.
The river was roaring nearby.
