Two other small, scalloped-edged photographs, probably taken in the same year, show the same child, now more slender, in a dress with flounces and balloon sleeves.
In the first she is mischievously snuggling up to a woman with a solid body, wearing a dress with wide stripes, her hair in big curls.
In the second she is raising her left fist, her right being held by a tall man in a light jacket and pinstriped trousers, with a nonchalant air.
The two photographs were taken on the same day in front of a wall with a flower border, in a paved courtyard.
Above their heads a clothesline passes, with a pin still hooked on it.
Another photograph, signed by the same photographer but the paper of the booklet is more ordinary and the gilt edging has disappeared no doubt destined for the same family distribution, shows a little girl of about four years old, serious, almost sad despite a good round face under short hair, parted in the middle and pulled back with barrettes to which ribbons are attached, like butterflies.
Her left hand rests on the same carved table, fully visible, in Louis XVI style.
She appears plump in her blouse, her pinafore rising in front due to a prominent stomach, perhaps a sign of rickets (1944, approximately).
The boys were proud to be leaving for the regiment and they looked handsome in their uniforms.
On the night of their conscription review they went around the bars to celebrate the glory of being recognized as real men.
Before the regiment they had been just kids and worth nothing in the job or marriage market.
Afterwards they could have a wife and children.
The uniform they wore around the neighborhood on leave was wrapped in patriotic beauty and virtual sacrifice.
The shadow of victorious fighters, GIs, floated around them.
The rough cloth of the tunic, brushed when you stood on tiptoe to kiss them, materialized the absolute break between the world of men and that of women.
Seeing them gave one a feeling of heroism.
Under the immutability, the posters of the circus of last year with the photo of Roger Lanzac, the first communion images distributed to the comrades, the Club of Songwriters on Radio Luxembourg, the days were filled with new desires.
On Sunday afternoons, people crowded around the window of the general electrical store in front of the television.
Cafes invested in the purchase of a set to attract customers.
On the slopes of the hills, motocross tracks snaked and one watched the deafening machines go up and down all day.
The growing impatience of commerce with its new slogans, "initiative", "dynamism", shook the daily routine of the cities.
Between the fair and the fair, the Commercial Fortnight settled as a rite of spring.
In the streets of the center, the loudspeakers roared with invitations to buy, interspersed with songs by Annie Cordy and Eddie Constantine, to win the Simca or the dining room.
On the podium, Place de la Mairie, a local animator made people laugh with the jokes of Roger Nicolas and Jean Richard, rounded up candidates for the Crochet or Quitte or double, as on the radio.
Seated in a corner of the podium, the Queen of Commerce reigned under her crown.
The merchandise advanced under the colors of the party.
People said "it changes" or "you must not get stuck, you get dull staying at home".
But they only spoke of what they had seen, which could be relived through eating and drinking.
They lacked the talent or the conviction to talk about what they knew but had not seen.
So there was no mention of Jewish children boarding trains to Auschwitz, of the dead of hunger picked up in the morning in the Warsaw ghetto, or of the 10,000 degrees at Hiroshima.
Hence the impression that history classes, documentaries and films later on would not dispel: neither the crematoria nor the atomic bomb belonged to the same era as the black market butter, the air raid sirens and the trips to the cellar.
They then compared the present war with the Great War of 1914, won in blood and glory, a war of men which the women at the table listened to with respect.
They spoke of the Chemin des Dames and Verdun, of the gassed, of the bells of the 11th of November 1918.
They named villages from which not one child who had gone to the front had returned.
They contrasted the soldiers in the mud of the trenches with the prisoners of 1940, warm and safe for five years, who had not even had a bomb dropped on their heads.
They argued about heroism and misfortune.
The children paid no attention and, as soon as they were allowed, they hurried away from the table, taking advantage of the general good-will of the holiday to indulge in forbidden games, jumping on the beds and swinging upside down.
But they remembered everything.
Beside the fabulous time—the episodes of which they would not be able to arrange for a long time yet—the Debacle, the Exodus, the Occupation, the Landing, the Victory—they found the nameless one in which they were growing up dull.
They regretted not having been born, or at least only just, when it was necessary to set out in a cohort on the roads and sleep on straw like gypsies.
They would keep a tenacious regret for this time they had missed by so little, and the memory of the others would pass on to them a secret nostalgia for this epoch and the hope of living it one day.
The frenzy that had followed liberation was beginning to die down.
Now people just wanted to get out and there were a lot of desires that needed to be satisfied right away.
Anything that was a first since the war caused a rush, like bananas, lottery tickets, and fireworks.
Entire neighborhoods, from grandmothers supported by their daughters to babies in prams, rushed to the fair, the torchlight parade, and Bouglione's circus, where they almost got trampled in the stampede.
They went in a praying and singing crowd to the road to welcome the statue of Our Lady of Boulogne and accompany it the next day for miles.
Whether it was secular or religious, any occasion was good enough for them to be outside together, as if they wanted to keep living collectively.
Sunday night, the buses came back from the sea with tall young people in shorts singing at the top of their lungs, perched on the roof of the luggage rack.
Dogs roamed freely and mated in the middle of the street.
Family stories and social stories were one and the same.
The voices of the guests outlined the spaces of their youth: the countryside and the farms where, from time immemorial, the men had been hired hands and the girls servants, the factory where they had all met, courted and married, the small businesses to which the most ambitious had aspired.
They drew stories with no personal events other than births, marriages and deaths, no travels outside of the regiment to a distant garrison town, lives occupied by work, its hardness and its weariness, the threat of alcohol.
School was a mythical background, a brief golden age of which the teacher had been the stern god with his iron ruler to rap on the knuckles.
Photos, browned and stained on the back by the fingers of all those who had held them at other meals, passed from hand to hand.
In the stiff and serious wedding-party, the guests arranged in several rows along a wall, one could not recognize either one's parents or anyone else.
Nor was it oneself that one saw in the half-naked, sexless baby on a cushion, but someone else, a creature belonging to a silent and inaccessible time.
