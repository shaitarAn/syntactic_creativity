The endless sea roar did not subside for a minute.
It came in long waves, sometimes intensifying, sometimes subsiding.
And the wind began to rustle in the bare trees, then fell silent, just like I did, listening to the flow of the night.
But it didn't go away, it was here.
I knew it by the smell of wet pebbles and the barely perceptible tremor of a solitary plane tree leaf.
I had noticed this stubborn gray leaf during the day, but now, at night, it seemed like a small living creature, my only awake friend.
Occasionally, gunshots echoed from the darkness, from the city, followed by the prolonged barking of dogs.
Then, far out at sea, a faint light flickered and went out.
He made us look at these things more closely and for longer than we usually do, and to discover in them many previously unnoticed qualities.
In the yellow, noseless stone, there were many small, tightly embedded sea shells, while on the branches of the drooping bushes, there were still a few faded colors, like damp, crumpled golden butterflies, patiently waiting for the sun.
But it rarely emerged from the fog as a faint white blotch, providing neither warmth nor shade.
Under the single old plane tree with lemon-colored spots on its trunk, the leaves lay like cut-out pieces of dull green velvet.
Along the cast-iron gutter,a procession of ants carried their last supplies for the winter,while near the anchor chain,a small timid frog lived.
Someone on the other side of the river started flashing a light and shouting loudly at night.
I went out with my uncle Ilko to the riverbank.
The river was roaring.
The water was flowing through the dam as a cold waterfall.
It was a late, silent night, not a single star was visible above.
The wind was blowing fiercely, carrying the freshness of thawed earth.
And all the time, someone on the other side was flashing a light and shouting, but the words were inaudible over the river's noise.
When they carried the coffin out onto the porch, I saw an old carriage on the other bank of the river, with tired horses tied to it and a small woman in black my mother.
She was standing motionless on the bank.
She saw from there how they were carrying my father.
Then she knelt down and fell face down onto the sand.
No, replied grandfather.
It's true, we haven't seen each other.
Ostap began to get blind.
He thought he would go to Petersburg to see that woman before he went completely blind.
He reached the capital and found out that she had died, maybe she couldn't bear the separation.
Ostap found her grave made of white marble on the cemetery, looked at it, and his heart burst his iron rose was lying on the stone.
That woman had left a will to place a rose on her grave forever.
And Ostap started to wander and, maybe, died on the road or in the market under a cart.
Amen!
On the opposite bank, the preserved forest of Countess Branitskaya rose up the slope.
The sun was unable to penetrate the dense foliage of this forest.
Only occasionally did a solitary ray of light slice through the canopy, revealing before us the stunning power of vegetation.
Like sparkling dust particles, small birds flitted into this ray, chirping as they chased each other and dived into the leaves, as if into a green sea.
I scooped water from the pond into a bucket, threw in some grass, and waited.
The red poppies stood motionless in the water.
Suddenly, one of them started trembling, making small circles, quickly diving or swimming away.
My father cast his line, the fishing rod bent into an arc, and in the mist above the pond, a mysterious commotion began.
The water churned, the cups of the water-measuring beetles hastily scattered in all directions, and finally, a golden glimmer appeared in the depths.
It was impossible to make out what it was until my father pulled out a heavy carp on a tangled line.
It lay on its side, panting and moving its fins.
From its scales came an amazing smell of "the underwater kingdom".
Yasha thought to himself for a few seconds.
We knew that it took seven minutes to walk from Sturdzo Street to the Landezmann Sanatorium.
Inside the sanatorium, behind the high fence and iron gates, we always felt completely safe.
Especially if we didn't light any cigarettes.
When we passed by the entrance, Yasha stumbled.
Later, when we recalled the incident in Sturdzo Street, Yasha claimed that he always did his best to make a mess of things.
I thought to myself that Yasha's annoying gait was to blame for everything.
But I kept quiet so as not to upset him.
We were creeping through the alley.
I said that we needed to walk on the side where the archway is, stop just before reaching it, listen closely, and then quickly and silently dash past the archway.
The plan, in my opinion, was mathematically precise.
If there are people in the archway, they might not even notice us.
However, if we were to walk on the opposite side from the archway, we may be spotted from a distance.
I calculated that in this latter case we would be walking towards this dangerous archway or simply being visible to whoever might have hidden in it five times longer.
And therefore there will be five times as many chances for us to get noticed.
In the morning, I woke up to the hot sun beating against the white walls.
Red and yellow marigolds swayed in the breeze outside the open window, accompanied by the scent of nasturtium; a furry bee was also peeking into the room.
I watched, mesmerized, as it angrily buzzed and struggled to escape from the tight flower.
Sunlit streams flowed endlessly across the ceiling, light waves reflecting the river's murmur.
The river was right nearby, its gentle rumble echoing through the air.
