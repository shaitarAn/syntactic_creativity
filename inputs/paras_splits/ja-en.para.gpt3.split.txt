Miho and Satsuki, who often meet in their hometown, have similar expressions and ways of speaking.
Especially when they eat sweets, they break them into small pieces with their manicured hands and bring them to their mouths.
I try to remember if they were always like this, but my memory is hazy.
I wonder if the little quirks and mannerisms they had when I last saw them have already been swept away somewhere.
Miho is now married and has bought an old house in her hometown, where her friends often gather.
Though she often finds it a chore to work tomorrow, it is her only connection to the world outside the convenience store, and a valuable opportunity to interact with other "normal thirty-something women" her age, so she tries to accept Miho's invitations as often as possible.
Today, the members were Miho, Yukari who had brought her still-small children, and Satsuki who was married but had no children yet.
We were at Miho's house, having tea and cakes that we had brought.
At that moment, I felt I had become a part of the world.
I was born anew.
I was born as a normal part of the world, on this day.
For two weeks, we practiced relentlessly, in pairs and with our colleagues, pretending to be customers.
We learned to smile and bow politely, to put sanitary items in paper bags, to separate hot and cold items, and to disinfect our hands with alcohol if we were asked for fast food.
The cash register was filled with real money, but the receipts were printed with the word "TRAINING" in large letters, and the people we served were our colleagues in the same uniform.
It felt like a game of pretend shopping.
My younger sister, two years my junior, was "normal"—not that she kept her distance from me, but rather that she looked up to me.
Whenever Mother scolded her for something ordinary, I would go up to Mother and ask why she was angry.
My sister, perhaps thinking I had come to her rescue, would always thank me.
I, who had no great interest in sweets or toys, would often give them to her.
For this reason, she was always trailing after me.
"Dad, I'm going to make some yakitori today."
My mother and the other mothers nearby seemed to have been taken aback, their eyes, noses and mouths all opening wide, when I repeated my words in a clear voice, as if they hadn't heard me the first time.
I almost laughed at their funny expressions, but then I noticed they were looking at the birds in my hand, and I realized one was not enough.
"Should I get more?"
My mother seemed to come to her senses when she saw the sparrows walking around in pairs and threes nearby.
"Eko!" she exclaimed in a scolding voice.
"Let's make a grave for them.
Look, everyone's crying.
It's sad when your friends die, isn't it?
Aren't they pitiful?"
"Why? They're already dead."
My mother was speechless at my question.
I quickly put a can of coffee, some cigarettes, and an Americano into a small bag.
Meanwhile, the man who had been jingling coins in his pocket suddenly reached into his breast pocket, as if he had just thought of something.
His gesture told me that he was about to pay with an electronic money card.
"Welcome! Good morning!"
I accepted the can of coffee that the male customer had offered me with a slight bow.
"Ah, and one pack of cigarettes, number five."
"Right away."
I quickly pulled out a Marlboro Light Menthol and scanned it at the register.
"Please touch the screen for age verification."
His gaze shifted to the show case with the fast food as he touched the screen, and I stopped my finger's movement.
I could ask him if he wanted something else, but when he seemed to be hesitating about buying something, I decided to step back and wait.
At the sound of coins jingling, I turned my head towards the cash register.
Most of the people who made this sound were buying cigarettes or newspapers and were about to leave, so I was sensitive to the sound of money.
Sure enough, there was a man with a can of coffee in one hand and his other hand in his pocket, heading towards the register.
I quickly moved inside the store and slid into the cash register counter, standing inside to make sure I didn't keep the customer waiting.
The convenience store is filled with sound.
The chime that rings when customers enter, the idol's voice advertising new products on the radio, the calls of the store clerks, the sound of barcodes being scanned, the sound of items being placed in baskets, the sound of plastic bags being gripped, and the sound of heels walking around the store—all these sounds mix together to form the "sound of the convenience store" that lingers in my ears.
