Diego Cocca will be the new national coach of Mexico.
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time.
Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early elimination in Qatar.
The 50-year-old was not considered a favorite for the position until a few days ago.
He only took over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November.
His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New plant signs should encourage replanting.
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) are putting up the plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht.
"Geesthacht is blooming" is the name of an initiative by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration.
With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day-care centers, businesses, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015.
The goal: to create extensive areas of flowering islands in the Geesthacht urban area where insects can find food at all times.
"In favorable weather conditions, bees already start looking for food in January," says Friedhelm Ringe from Nabu Geesthacht.
He has beehives on his property himself.
To ensure that the endeavor is not just an action by conservationists and the environmental department of the city, but reaches far into private gardens, explanatory signs about the plants are repeatedly placed.
There are currently about 50 signs.
Passers-by should be able to inform themselves about what is currently blooming so beautifully here.
The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant these species at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel already had its season start.
Shrubs of more recent origin such as winter honeysuckle and winter snowball are found in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
They have been planted in the planters on Bergedorer Straße for a year now and are currently displaying their first delicate white and pink flowers without leaves.
Recently, additional signs have been placed next to them.
"The winter honeysuckle is a very bushy shrub that can grow up to two meters high and three meters wide," reads one of the signs, providing information about suitable planting locations.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bedding plants are now showing flowers.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel already had its season start.
It blooms particularly luxuriantly on Richtweg near the incline, on Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many hedge rows.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Dancing keeps me young"
Munich Dance god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her when he looks down from heaven to Munich East Station!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 3 pm for a lively tap dance together, they are an incredible 277 years old, excuse me, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich resident (15th January 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week.
"Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine myself without it."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing their dance legs.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926.
She was a soubrette, today one would say musical performer, and worked together with the legendary Marika Rökk.
"I have spent my life with dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the newbie in the group of tap dancers.
She says: "We simply have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world.
With two metal plates attached to the front and back of the shoes, which are more durable than the originally used wooden soles, rhythmical sounds are created while dancing that match the visual impression and the music.
The dancer thereby also becomes a percussion musician.
The English term for this is onomatopoeically "Tap dance" and in French it is called "Claquettes".
The Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing.
In this style, nails are hammered into the tips of the shoes to produce an easily audible sound while dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the loving soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof.
She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer.
"We are a big family, where young and old are welcome."
And what is the recipe for such a long life?
"Exercise keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD.
Her advice to everyone: "Sports, healthy food, and no alcohol."
Analog in dialogue
The limits of the digital.
With advancing digitalization, the desire for analogue grows again in some people.
The rapid pace at which our everyday life became digital left us with little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and work methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden.
If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options.
Either you belonged to the six percent of lucky ones who had a private connection.
Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a call with relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger.
Or you went to a telephone booth.
Unforgettable was the smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of coins in the coin slot.
My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when making calls video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
How to proceed in Moldova?
14 days for a new government.
In Moldova (also: Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has entrusted former Minister of Interior Dorin Recean with forming the government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so.
So far, Recean has been one of the advisors to the president.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned.
The pro-European government leader was under tremendous pressure, as she stated herself as the reason for her resignation apparently she was being targeted by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war.
Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European Party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats.
Therefore, the confirmation of the new prime minister and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, in the past months, pro-European politicians in Moldova have lost popularity, while pro-Russian ones with support from the Kremlin have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities.
In 2023, there will be proper celebrations again in Veitshöchheim.
The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't hesitate for long.

Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests.
He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria.
By his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the Paw Patrol children's hero Chase for his costume.
From the depths of the sea, Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia.
Completely disconnected: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is heading to space.
Landtag President
Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as her role model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bayern's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne.
She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann.
By his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the Walz: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume.
His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition must, of course, not be missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party faction leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD faction leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
It was royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen.
He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more.
In Veitshöchheim, the faction leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a mime.
At his side was Frau Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can at least do magic.

Oberhof: Kühn eighth in World Championship sprint.
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season.
The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen.
The biathlon icon, who is serving as a TV expert on-site, remains the unrivaled record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals.
Even partial heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig.
On Wednesday, he had already secured a successful title defense with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the third hunting race there will be sequels.
In pursuit, Bö once again is the clear favorite.
His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate shooting errors astonishingly easily up to a certain extent.
In the meantime, things were not going well again for Doll.
After the veteran had missed all chances of a medal in the mixed relay with a penalty lap at the start and only finished in sixth place, three days later it didn't get any better.
Three penalty laps in prone shooting and two more standing laps were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated his biggest career success in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he won unexpectedly six years ago with a narrow margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bø.
It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has so far stood on the podium once this winter.
The eighth Olympic finisher in Beijing silently left after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews.
Roman Rees managed to finish in 19th place, while the second World Championship debutant David Zobel came in at 35th place.
Biden meets Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
During a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main focus is on the value of democracy.
Both reflect on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington.
"We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength."
Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a runoff against Bolsonaro at the end of October.
Lula took office on January 1.
The change of power was accompanied by violent riots.
Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January.
The outbreak of violence in Brazil is reminiscent in a somber way of the storming of the US Capitol over two years ago, when supporters of then President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament building in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden.
His predecessor did not care much for international relations.
"His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula.
"Sounds familiar to me," Biden replied an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note on the press der Freitag Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters?
They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who have been marked for denouncement and assassination.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous enemies of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society.
(Here nothing about the truly dangerous ones in pinstriped suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more interested in rowdies on the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is releasing a new edition with Putin's "war criminal" friends.
Because they are so beautiful, there is a photo gallery.
Of course, the StZ is poorly informed because there may be more "friends of Russia" in this world, including Asia, Africa and Latin America, than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but rather:
In positions 1 to 5 (!) is Mrs. Wagenknecht, then follows Mrs. Schwarzer.
Now, I don't know anyone in my surroundings who reads this paper anymore.
If they do, it would be high time now.
We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing less than that.
And no later than now, dialectically sound, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all not completely brainwashed, i.e. Peace-loving, pacifist, and antimilitarist people.
(And now there is no need for further differentiation.)
Harald
Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth.
Designer
Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated.
This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in identical wording.
It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for dissolution of his civil partnership with his family attorney at the competent court.
I will not comment on details."
Glööckler and his life partner
Schroth were together for 35 years, rumors of separation have been circulating for about a year.
According to various media reports, the fashion designer is said to have already moved out of their shared house in Pfalz to Berlin after participating in the jungle camp.
He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacres in Oradour-sur-Glane:
Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999.
France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded
Hébras with the National Order of Merit a year ago.
Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, said Macron.
He also contributed to German-French peace.
Among other things, the survivor campaigned for German-French youth exchanges.

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian
Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflationary rates to be "absolutely" necessary.
"The inflationary risks remain significant.
The costs of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag".
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and announced another increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16.
The key interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent.
The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates increase the cost of loans.
This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates.
Higher loan interest rates can also lead to postponed investments, resulting in weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are a burden even for heavily indebted eurozone countries such as Italy.
"The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said.
"Of course, we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent.
This target has been far from reach for months.
In January, although price pressures weakened again, consumer prices in the currency area were still 8.5 percent higher than the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers because they can afford less for one euro.
Sharply increased energy prices, which play a major role in driving inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "eventually collapse," warned Sewing, who is also the president of the Association of German Banks (BdB).
"I currently see this as the biggest risk to the German economy.
But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" in infrastructure projects announced by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD).
"There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it.
And it may also be a bit controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart.
He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge that does not necessarily have to be as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened after ten months of planning and construction.
The goal was to partially close the gap in gas supply caused by Russia's lack of gas deliveries.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke about a new "Germany speed" on this occasion.
Additionally, the German government recently initiated an acceleration of approval processes for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is indeed very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters.
However, this should not automatically mean that we always act categorically from now on and, for example, place a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung.
Therefore, there should still be a negotiation process about what society deems right and wrong."
In the past, we tried using the classical set of rules and failed.
"We should reconsider whether our previous approach was correct.
Maybe we exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
Given the many outstanding tasks, such as expanding the power grid, Hartung said he does not envy the federal government and the involved companies.
"As a consumer of these energies, I definitely need this expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Trade Union warns against dismantling of Bayer corporation.
The chemical workers' union IG BCE warns of the dismantling of the company following an announced change in leadership at Bayer.
"From the employees' perspective, Bayer is well positioned for future challenges with its three pillars," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and member of Bayer's supervisory board, in an interview with the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medications, and the agricultural business are meant.
"You can only master the transformation of the industry with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the CEO change announced on Thursday at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company.
The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down this summer.
Taking over in early June will be former pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson.
Baumann has long been criticized.
The manager is burdened by the 2018 acquisition of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion.
With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the herbicide glyphosate upon itself.
Bayer's stock has been in decline for years.
In 2019, shareholders even denied the CEO discharge at the general meeting.
It had long been known that Baumann did not intend to extend his contract, which was actually supposed to run until 2024.
Long-term strategic investors had exerted pressure.
Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors like Bluebell Capital also got involved.
According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the company.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach.
"A spin-off of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, to the "Rheinische Post."
On the other hand, he considers a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science division not feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris
Even on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's project with concentrated protest on the streets.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are once again expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday.
For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.
Already twice, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes.
Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests.
A turbulent debate on the controversial reform has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Many people in France already work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not contributed enough for a full pension by reaching the retirement age.
The opponents of the reform believe that in many physically demanding professions, people will hardly be able to work longer.
Additionally, employees want to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health in their jobs.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund.
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund.
Because the population is getting older, workers would have to contribute to an increasing number of retirees with their contributions.
In order to maintain the level of pensions, the population would have to work slightly more.
Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system balanced.
However, the government wants to make changes not only to the retirement age.
The already decided increase of the necessary contribution period for a full pension is supposed to be accelerated.
In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished.
The minimum pension is expected to rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important initiatives.
During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and even then there were massive protests and strikes.
Numerous presidents before Macron made efforts, with varying degrees of success, to reform the French pension system widespread protest and strikes were guaranteed for all.
Since Macron's party no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support.
However, some of the deputies even from Macron's own faction still have reservations.
And at the moment, Macron's concern over paralyzing strikes is likely even greater than fear of a close vote.
Before the demonstrations on Saturday, the President said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected lots of sun in high elevations
A powerful high-pressure system is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany.
Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, quiet high pressure weather is expected at least until midweek.
"When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday.
"Although this high will shift slightly to the east over the course of next week, it will continue to dominate the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel.
"Such a high-pressure system can even be quite mean and bring people in the lowlands days of dreary foggy gray conditions, while there is pure sunshine in the higher elevations of the low mountain ranges."
So the Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions.
According to the DWD, there may be some rain from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria.
Especially at the foothills of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, cloud cover will break up during the day, and the sun will increasingly come out.
In the rest of country, it will remain mostly cloudy or covered with high fog-like clouds.
Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, around 10 degrees Celsius near the Rhine region.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble away at the high fog and dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist.
On the edge of the Alps, in the high elevations of the low mountain ranges, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sunshine is expected all day long.
Elsewhere, it will have to fight its way through the high fog layer.
The maximum temperatures range from 5 to 9 degrees Celsius, around 11 degrees expected at Niederrhein, while only around 3 degrees are expected in persistent grayness in the southeast.
In addition, there will be a weak wind coming from different directions."
On Tuesday, there may again be persistent fog or low clouds in some low-lying areas.
Otherwise, the weather will be sunny after the fog clears.
According to forecasts, the sun will shine all day in high altitudes, large parts of NRW, and along the Alpine foothills.
Depending on the sunshine, temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees Celsius.
Dominator struggles: Still no World Cup medal for Goggia.
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia showed herself very disappointed after her elimination in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not deliver the performance that I am capable of," said the Italian woman on ZDF, after she had taken a tumble at a goal and was eliminated.
At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall just in time.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years.
She has won four out of the six season races in this discipline so far.
After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing.
However, Goggia, who is known for her risky skiing style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her specialty discipline.
Two years ago, she missed out on her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood.
It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France.
"I am disappointed.
I gave it my all.
But that's life."
Sometimes one believes things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that was expected by all experts but ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin:

Since February 10th, Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station.
Police are asking for information regarding her whereabouts.
Berlin.
With the release of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in searching for a missing child.
The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children towards Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 pm on February 10, 2023.
She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station.
The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has only very limited German language and local knowledge.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation.
Kyiv.
Sport politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by demanding the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
It was announced on a joint conference call that an agreement had been reached to draft a statement in order to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back from international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports reported on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain.
It had been a very productive meeting, wrote the British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter.
"And I have made Great Britain's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented in the Olympic Games.
We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives.
"While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky.
He published his speech on his Telegram channel.
Due to the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately stained with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott.
Ukraine also sees
Belarus as a belligerent party because the country provides military bases for attacks by Russian troops.
Selenskyj called on officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the participation of Russian athletes in the competitions.
The President further reiterated his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its integrity."
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions.
Ukraine also threatens to boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position.
The Ministry of the Interior responsible for sports confirmed afterwards that it had also reiterated its rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes participating in Paris.
"From our perspective, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports back to competitions.
Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community.
The efforts of the IOC to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong approach," said a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior in response to a query from dpa.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum."
Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions.
However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.
IOC President
Thomas Bach recently stated that an exclusion "based on a passport or place of birth" would violate the prohibition of discrimination.

Half of the vehicles lost? : US officials see Moscow's tank inventory heavily depleted.
Half of the vehicles lost?
USA sees
Moscow's tank inventory significantly decimated.
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war.
It is said to be "half of the main inventory."
According to estimates from the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its combat tanks in their offensive war against Ukraine.
"Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information about the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to the US assessment during an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine is expected to receive several combat tanks from multiple Western allies.
Britain has promised to deliver Challenger-2 combat tanks to Kyiv in March.
Germany, in coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April.
The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams combat tanks; however, their delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks.
"As we know, our foreign enemy has begged for airplanes, rockets, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk.
"It is clear that in this case it is only natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in effect in Russia that allows for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army.
This means that certain industries can be obligated to supply the armed forces.
Controversy surrounding appointment in the army.
Because the position that Christian Ortner, former director of the Military History Museum (HGM), will assume in the future was not advertised.
The staff representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption and abuse of office.
Defense
Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously unoccupied position, according to the Minister.
She does not want to comment on "speculations by a representative of the Freedom Party."
Ortner was replaced at the helm of HGM last year after 17 years.
In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying.
From Tanner's point of view, these have been resolved.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortners' suitability in terms of content.
He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process".
The decision has the "appearance of cronyism", says SPÖ defense spokesperson Robert Laimer.
The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment.
The ÖVP is still "deeply involved in a corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for defense matters.
He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools buckle under costs.
Thuringia's carnival stronghold
Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital.
However, higher costs, including security costs, are difficult to manage in Wasungen as well, says carnival president Marcel Kißling.
The funds alone account for about half of the estimated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are canceled in Brandenburg.
The "Parade of Happy People" in Cottbus, likely once again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic.
No parades were canceled even during the Swabian-Alemannic Fasching.
Despite the increased costs, Marne, the carnival stronghold of Schleswig-Holstein, is sticking to its traditional parade.
"We will carry out our event," says Heiko Claußen, the president of the carnival society.
However, financial worries are also pressing here:
If more sponsors are not found or if existing sponsors do not contribute more, reserves would have to be tapped into "that's not possible every year".
The current deficit is approximately 200,000 euros.
And the inflation:
According to Elvira
Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Association, there has been a price increase of up to 60 percent for sweets.
Fortunately, there was an over-ordering in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time.
However, it has already been decided that it will be more expensive for the parade.
Double the amount of staff will be needed for security compared to 2020.
Those standing on the sidelines of the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland may receive fewer candies than before.
Some participants in the parade don't have as much due to the increased price of sweets.
Regardless of candies, there is expected to be a large number of visitors: "I think that if it doesn't rain buckets on that day, we can expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne parade leader.
"This is due to the fact that no regular Rose Monday parade has taken place for two years.
The parade cannot be replaced by anything".
The Cologne Carnival Committee does not provide detailed information on costs.
However, they generally state that the parade is "deficitary", which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and homemade vodka
The Ukrainians are rightly known for their ability to drink.
There is domestic beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv.
Every now and then I discover German beer here.
Not Kulmbacher, but other big breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner.
In terms of taste, I can't really notice a big difference.
The same goes for vodka, which is widespread here.
They distill it themselves especially in the villages, calling it Samargon.
No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics.
In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had dropped by an incredible 80 percent in five years.
Well, you can see here how little one can trust the Russians too.
It is said that as a tourist one should be careful with it.
But that only applies when buying in bulk where it's likely mixed with something else.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for its high effort: "Match luck on our side"

Biathlon World Championships: Federal President predicts victory for favorites and praises Oberhof.
Federal President
Frank-Walter
Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof.
The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Championship sprint.
But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range really fell.
"I had to get the results on my phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier said with a smile, referring to the fog that kept moving into the stadium along Rennsteig and significantly impaired visibility for spectators.
Steinmeier still enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel:
"Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions.
The athletes also say so with thanks to those who have been involved here since the awarding of the World Championships".
In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and therefore "secure for the next years and even decades".
Once again, Norwegian Johannes Thingnes
Bö left the competition far behind.
Despite a penalty loop due to a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter season in 23:21.7 minutes and thus his second world championship title in Oberhof.
His brother Tarjei, who had a flawless shooting performance, finished 14.8 seconds behind him, while Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty loop/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to compete for medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph.
Johannes Kühn, with a shooting error and a gap of 1:04.8 minutes, finished as the top German in eighth place.
World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and placed twelfth (1:14.6).
Two bright spots amidst the gray veil.
On the other hand, Benedikt Doll once again disappointed.
After his failed mixed event on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five targets untouched this time and left deeply disappointed and without comment into the locker room as 55th place.
Bö started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and despite the difficult visibility conditions, he solidified this status.
However: he was lucky with his last two standing shots; they hit the edge of the target but still fell.
The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five years older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday.
In contrast, German hopes in the women's category rest on Herrmann-Wick.
"If you start with number one, the goal is not to finish tenth.
It's all about full throttle and attack to defend number one," said sports director Felix Bitterling, holding his "locomotive" accountable.
The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 pm and 3:30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "bee swarm" on the pitch.
Felix Brych Referee
Felix Brych calls for a referee ball.
Aggressively approaching players or complaining coaches?
Germany's referees want to consistently penalize unsportsmanlike conduct.
Referee chief
Fröhlich points out a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative trends in the interaction on the field.
"I think there are indeed new behaviors from players who swarm around the referee after decisions and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency.
"We discussed this during the winter break.
We decided that we do not want to accept such unsporting behavior.
We will pay closer attention to it again and we will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches were also given official warnings.
The Mainz coach Bo Svensson received a red card during the cup defeat against FC Bayern.
Freiburg's coach Christian Streich was issued a yellow-red card after the league loss in Dortmund.
"Coach behavior is also considered unsporting conduct.
We have noticed that unsporting behavior has increased in this area, that the attitude towards referees has become more demanding or aggressive.
We want to consistently penalize such misconduct," said Brych.
DFB referee chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and officials.
"Overall, the relationship fits.
There are reactions, followed by consistent counteractions.
The affected party must then live with it.
That shouldn't be earth-shattering," said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
"Conflicts can indeed arise from emotionality during gameplay.
But when emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then one must also accept that the corresponding measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich.
In recent cases, the parties involved have resolved things afterwards.
"It would only be important if there was also a general change of mindset that such behavior is simply not acceptable," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich."
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level.
"Of course, incidents in professional football always have an impact.
There is a role-model effect, resulting in imitation.
In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich.
"Regardless of the consistent interpretation of rules during the game, a clarifying conversation with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those involved is always helpful."
Combiner
Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter.
Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes do not compete in the Black Forest in the best line-up.
Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not there.
They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21st to March 5th in Planica, Slovenia.
"We have three world-class athletes at home.
The team naturally feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5.
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the A5 motorway near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children.
According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit the car in front of them during a slight traffic jam, causing it to collide with two other cars.
The full closure of the lanes heading towards Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) have launched the exhibition: they are standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition at the Marl Sculpture Museum comes to an end.
There will be some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wallbound" takes place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 pm in the transitional location of the Marler Sculpture Museum on Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
In three exhibition rooms, two large-scale wall paintings each draw attention to themselves.
After the exhibition, the walls will be repainted, the artworks will disappear.
However, a catalog documents the works specifically created for the Marler Museum.
It will be presented on February 12th by curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
For the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community.
Using numerous image examples, she presents the particularities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and examines its connections to this artistic genre in the Federal Republic of Germany with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting during the Weimar Republic.
Since then, she has been researching architecture-related art as well as the art and institutional history of post-war Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on public art in North Rhine-Westphalia.
After the lecture, the final curatorial tour of the exhibition will take place.
The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey.
It's about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings:
In the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul.
Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in the southern region of Turkey following building collapses during the earthquake.
In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued against 33 individuals, as reported by the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors.
The suspects are alleged to be responsible for construction defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings.
As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far.
According to reports, one of the suspects was apprehended at Istanbul airport.
He is said to have attempted to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody awaiting trial, as reported by Anadolu.
Nine more people were reportedly arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
On early Monday morning, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 shook the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 at noon.
More than 7500 buildings collapsed, only in Turkey.
Former
Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag.
The 95-year-old passed away during the night to Saturday.
Faction leader
Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left party politician as a "profoundly sincere socialist."
"Last night, 'Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95,' announced the Left Party faction in the Bundestag on Saturday.
The party is losing 'an important personality,' declared faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and former faction chief Gregor Gysi."
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden.
As Prime Minister, he witnessed the end of East Germany.
Just four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of East Germany for about 150 days.
In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his position one month later.
He was followed as the last Prime Minister of East Germany until reunification by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The faction leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short messaging service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist."
Bartsch added: Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed.
"The entire peaceful course of the reunification of Germany was indeed a special merit of his.
That will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
It goes on: His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population who were not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.
After reunification, Modrow served as a member of the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994, and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow saw the new state "quite critically".
The German reunification had taken place too quickly, the GDR had collapsed unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state", Modrow criticized in numerous interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks.
Meanwhile, Kyiv has to carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kyiv
The recent wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing repairs to be made on the Ukrainian energy grid.
However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions.
Several thermal and hydro power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy company Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television.
The situation with power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad.
Due to instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr
Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism.
However, in a video message, he reported to his fellow countrymen how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj will not abandon the small town of Bachmut.
On February 24th, there will have been a war for a year.
US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary.
The danger from Russian missile attacks continued through the night on Saturday.
In the capital city of Kyiv, air raid sirens were activated for the fifth time on Friday evening.
"There is a threat of an attack with drones," announced the military administration of the Kyiv region.
Combat drones of Iranian make were also sighted and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiw and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultants for network company Demands, including those from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign, to separate these were unsuccessful due to the coalition partner SPD.
In the coalition agreement, they agreed on a compromise of an infrastructure company that is intended to be orientated towards the common good in the future.
This means it does not need to generate profits or contribute them.
Backlog of renovation worth 80 billion euros.
The two consulting firms are supposed to help the government accompany this process.
The backlog in renovations on the rail network is a significant reason why the train service is currently very unreliable.
Minister of Transport
Wissing has made it his task to eliminate this problem by carrying out complete renovations of entire rail corridors.
The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros.
However, according to newer calculations by the railway company, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023
Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances apparently did not speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick.
She had slept poorly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited," her heart rate hadn't come down even during warm-up.
"Such a race," and at the home World Championships, "you can't put it into words," she said.
11,000 spectators cheered to booming German Schlager music with German flags, coaches and team members embraced each other.
"Enjoy biathlon", that was what she had planned.
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high.
The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, hope for a German medal outside of the relays.
Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter.
She currently ranks fifth in the overall World Cup standings.
And even though the level of competition among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, one would have expected others to be on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state.
He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom.
The relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been highly strained since 2018.
At that time, protesters who were demanding Ortega's resignation sought refuge in churches.
During the protests, more than 350 people died in 2018.
In the following years, thousands of people left the Central American country, often out of fear of repression or arrests.
President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
German Armed Forces:
Defense industry demands more orders from special assets
First armament projects have therefore already been canceled, further projects are threatened with the same fate, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag".
However, which specific investments would be cut cannot yet be determined.
"There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a potential need for savings at this time," said a response from the German government to an inquiry from Member of Parliament Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background of the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates.
The fully loan-financed special fund, which the German Bundestag had decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest burdens for the loans itself.
If these increase, less money is available for specific acquisitions for the Bundeswehr.
In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum decreases.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway at the Kupferzell on-ramp towards Heilbronn.
At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was traveling on B 19 towards Künzelsau, as reported by the police.
During the turning maneuver of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident scene showed "green" for them.
An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no deficiencies.
Further investigations will follow.
In the accident, the 24-year-old, 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured.
They had to be taken to a hospital.
The two cars sustained a total property damage of approximately 20,000 euros.
Castle Square
Stuttgarters commemorate the victims of the earthquake catastrophe.
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake catastrophe in Turkey and Syria.
The sympathy is great even in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world.
On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men.
They all listened to the Imam's supplication prayer seriously and silently.
In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe.
He asked among other things for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other.
The community also sought support and strength to "bring our aid to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria.
The spokespersons expressed their sympathy for the affected individuals and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event.
The supplications were also translated into German at Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great.
Several million euros have already been raised in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevite community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations of goods on Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake-stricken areas.
The willingness to help was overwhelming there as well.
Hike with meat filling Ebersberg After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps.
The elders know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice.
Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance.
Because thanks to home office, instead of sitting in the middle of a desert of stones, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, people now use their lunch breaks either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as an alternative for a walk in fresh air.
At least that's how it seems around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 pm not only dog owners gather.
One reason could also be that in the course of optimal time slot utilization, modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things.
Because why not learn news from the settlement during a short walk through nature with a long unseen neighbor?
Or meet the friend whom you never manage to go to the cinema with in the evenings, not even to the old cinema?
This way, work and personal life can be combined who says that appointments with tax consultants, lawyers or investment advisors cannot take place outdoors?
Of course, as long as there are no eavesdroppers nearby.
What one can also accomplish is the acquisition of provisions.
Fresh fruit, for example, that is displayed along with little baskets on a table by the roadside.
Or potatoes and meat.
It's just unfortunate if one hasn't already thought about making the purchase and taken appropriate precautions.
Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer empty-handed and with regret in their voice.
"Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money."
The disappointment can be felt since one has a companion with a wallet but not a container for transportation.
One also lets the friendly chance acquaintance know this.
To which the man replies, "But that's not true!
You do have a bag with you!"
He points to the hood of the jacket that one quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary.
"My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that one embarks on the return journey with a meat filling, and during this midday short outing, not only does one become richer in terms of a lamb loin, but also in terms of a particularly practical idea.
It is quite possible that on this day a second walk will be necessary after dinner.
This time for digestion indeed.
Trapped and seriously injured.
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons yet unknown, veered to the right off the road in a left turn, according to the police report.
In doing so, the Audi damaged a roadside post, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop several meters away.
The driver was trapped inside his car as a result of the collision.
The fire department freed him using heavy equipment.
The emergency medical service transported the seriously injured person to a hospital.
Due to suspicion of impaired driving ability, blood samples were ordered to be taken.
According to the police report, there was extensive damage totaling €1000 to the Audi.
Donald Trump's tax records:
Point for the rule of law.
The US Department of Justice has decided: the tax authorities must hand over the former president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, back when he was still in office as the President of the United States.
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, said the decision of the ministry on Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the USA, real estate businessman Trump did not publicly disclose his tax returns as a candidate or later as president.
He fought all the way to the Supreme Court against their release.
A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public unless a trial occurred.
The handover to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of people with access is slightly larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation.
In addition, confidential information from the parliament keeps leaking to the outside.
The Chairwoman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law".
Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter.
"The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi stated.

British serial criminal caught in Thailand after long escape.
London
After five years on the run, a convicted drug smuggler from Britain has been captured in Thailand.
The British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday that the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police at an auto repair shop in Bangkok.
The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of fugitives.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled before the start of a trial in early 2018, in which he had been sentenced in absentia to eleven years imprisonment for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table Bielefeld
What is being served remains a mystery in advance.
Because people should primarily come to the Vesperkirche to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu.
It starts this Sunday, then the Neustädter Marienkirche will be turned into a dining room for two weeks.
Cabaret Stories from the Big Apple Vince
Ebert has a mission:
The physics graduate from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statement, loves Viennese humor, advocates for science in his cabaret programs.
The programmatic title of his current solo show "Make Science Great Again" fits well with this.
Whether this fits well into the generally prevailing skepticism towards science in this country is debatable.
However, his humor certainly fits very well into Vienna.
By the way, the English title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story.
In 2019, he tried to make a living as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year.
But now he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what Wissenaft really is and what it can do—and especially what it cannot.
Of course, Corona is mentioned too, but so are German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many keep pushing away:
What is really important?
All of this with a huge wink, composed and very ironic.
And so, not only are we well entertained, but we can also learn something along the way.
Please go for registration... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.

Peace and Security in Times of Transition?
On Monday, May 15th at 6:00 PM, the Solidarity Church, the Peace Council, and the Protestant City Academy invite you to a lecture and discussion event at the Protestant University on the topic "Peace and Security in Times of Transition?"
I really don't understand why they don't hold such events on Sundays.
Or not in the city.
What does the #Bahn actually not do to scare off customers and further damage its image!?

Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard reveals details and prices of monetization

#DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various colors are traveling together (!) to Germany for the first time.
I'm excited to see who I will meet there and who I will get to know there ;-)
Party colleague
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is 11, as is the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, who is also a CDU minister.
So that is really nothing new, it's like this with every electronic ticket.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device
BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor.
This game visualizes the battle scenes from the perspective of a tank driver.
The battles take place in a wide valley completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes.
In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and boulders that provide temporary protection to the player as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles that are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay.
Additionally, UFOs appear periodically.
These cannot attack the player's tank, but the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO.
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes: attraction mode, game introduction mode, game mode, initial input for high scores, and self-test mode.
The latter operating mode is a special process for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Game process
The gameplay is triggered when the START button is pressed.
The LED switch remains illuminated and the sounds of the game become audible.
If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is ended.
The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen.
The player can determine the position of each enemy tank or rocket by observing the displayed text in the upper left corner of their cockpit's notification display angle.
A hint could be, for example: "ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT."
In addition, a point representing the enemy position becomes visible on an extensive radar screen accompanied by a Sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the underlying screen.
If the opponent is in this area, they can be targeted well on the screen.
Furthermore, ENEMY IN FIRING RANGE is displayed in the upper left indicator display at the same time.
Periodically, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield.
These are harmless flying objects that observe the combat and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank.
The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar.
The UFOs are intended to complement the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles.
UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the opponent's tank.
A shot by the player earns them 5,000 points.
If an opponent is hit, following points are reached:
For a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points, and for a super-tank 3,000 points.
A super-tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy slow-moving tank.
Several options give the operator an opportunity to use 2, 3 ,4 or even 5 tanks during gameplay.
Furthermore, after reaching predefined scores a bonus-tanks can be unlocked and for further difficulty in gameplay,the appearance of missiles can be varied.
The details and specific switch positions for these setting options can be seen in Figure [referenced figure number].
5. Initial input for top results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of high scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game ends.
The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages.
It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply will erase the high score table.
When erased (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are retained and written back onto the screen to challenge other players.
Any score exceeding 100,000 will also be marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials.
If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by computer.
Afterward, the device switches back to attract mode gameplay.
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components.
If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences.
The new parts are: A.
The control lever.
This is a redesign of the ATARI gear shift lever.
It has been strengthened by several additional ribs on the inner and outer housing parts, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts.
Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, constantly brings the control lever back to the middle position.
The microswitches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement.
B. Two PC boards.
ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been expanded onto two (2) interconnected boards—namely, the Analog Vector Generator board and the auxiliary board—which use this circuitry technique to generate more lines on the screen at higher speeds, resulting in a smooth and steady image display.
C.
The power supply unit.
Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply unit that includes a larger, more powerful transformer to handle increased power requirements due to circuit expansion.
D.The device housing.
Due to its new design,it was now possible to incorporate a larger coin capacity cash box into it.
There is also a console inside designed as a platform for younger players,to make gaming easier.
Atthe same time,this console ensures maximum stability ofthe device atthe installation location These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1.
If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol.
2. Device inspection.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play.
However, you should perform a certain inspection to complete the quality control.
To ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out:
NOTE:
Do not connect the device to the 220V power supply yet.
A. Examine the exterior of the housing for any damages.
B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and inspect the components inside as follows:
(1) Check all cable harness connectors for correct and secure connections.
Connect any open or loose connectors together if necessary.
NOTE: Never forcefully establish plug connections.
The plugs are equipped with a directional guide so that a correct connection is made.
A plug connection twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2)
Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm seating.
(3)
Note the device's production number on the nameplate on the back of the device.
Check if the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board, and TV monitor.
A diagram showing the location of the production number is located on the back cover of this manual.
This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for further service information.
(4)
Check all other main components such as power supply, control console, and TV monitor for proper assembly.
(5)
Finally, connect and power on the device with mains voltage.
Look through the player's viewing glass to verify ifthe radar screen is positioned within th bright orange circled opening in th enclosure.
Ifthe opening is not perfectly centered,the enclosure attached with adhesive tape to hehousing must be loosenedand realigned.

DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE?
Below you will find a series of tips that can help you solve most issues related to current DirectX games.
Checking the system configuration.
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging.
If you are unsure whether your PC meets the requirements, you can use the DirectX diagnostic program to get an overview of your system.
Please follow these steps to access the DirectX diagnostic program:
Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option.
Enter "dxdiag" in the text box.
The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program will now be displayed.
Here, you have access to all relevant system details, including information about your graphics and sound card.
Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound are functioning correctly by clicking on corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound.
Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program before starting the game.
It can happen that other programs occupy the system resources that the game needs to run smoothly.
It is not always obvious with all of these programs that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system boots up.
Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications".
In some cases, they can be the cause of your program freezing or crashing.
Therefore, we recommend closing such background applications before starting the game.
If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game.
To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar.
Right-click on the icon and select the corresponding option ("Disable", "Close", or similar).
Once you have disabled antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications as they can sometimes cause issues when installing or running a PC game.
You can read more about this in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications".
Cleaning up your system
Before installing software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally.
It is therefore advisable to make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals.
The tools you need for this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly.
This will greatly increase the chances of current games running smoothly on your PC.
A "clean" system also has the advantage of operating much more efficiently, resulting in faster and more stable performance for other applications you may use.
Consult the Windows help files for information on using the ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation, and disk cleanup tools.
Assistive Feature Usage 1.
Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to access the Windows Help.
2.
Now click on the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation", and "Disk Cleanup".
You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Does the game crash or freeze?
In games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.
This can often prevent a game from crashing or freezing.
First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer.
Here are some of the current graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games in me was ignited by the emergence of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits.
It represented for me an opportunity to explore new horizons.
I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual.
To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger.
I had this dull feeling that video games only exploited a tiny part of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and overlooked a fundamental element of human experience: emotions.
Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress.
Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true medium for conveying emotions.
Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest achievement is indeed the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered.
Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not solely based on fighting repulsive monsters in dark corridors and shooting crates for ammunition but has much more demanding and profound content.
It is proof that you can tell a story and offer gameplay without having to sacrifice either narrative or interactive elements as a result.
I hope both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience.
If you are rather skeptical about video games, I may hope that Fahrenheit helps change your attitude towards them.
May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talents, and ambitions.
For interactivity is still in its infancy and offers us all the chance to discover everything anew.
In the past two years,Fahrenheit has filled a significant part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us time and again to question many of the previously unquestionable principles.
I would consider myself fortunate if Fahrenheit like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you also doesn't pass by without leaving a trace on you.

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game will start for one or (with a minimum of 2 credits) for 2 players.
The objective is to try to occupy as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without touching the wandering SPARX.
The gameplay is set in a way that a minimum required area must be occupied before starting the next area (round).
At the top edge of the screen, timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines.
When these lines intersect, additional SPARX are released.
When an alarm goes off, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive.
If, while trying to draw your territory, your marker enters into the death spiral, it will be destroyed since you cannot cross or go back on your own path.
If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will ignite and destroy your marker.
Two speed settings are available: slower drawing speed doubles points earned.
After opening up the control panel, access can be gained to four programming and testing switches.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working properly.
For more information see "Service Program".
The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

Pressing the "Up" switch resets the values to 0.
Pressing the "Test" switch displays the next program display.
Program for coin entry/normal money setting.
With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be chosen or another setting can be programmed by the operator.
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons selects the programming while the top digit lights up in green on the screen.
The size values change with the change of the digit.
When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is adopted.
If a desired setting does not correspond to the default setting, values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button.
After one press, the upper adjustment number is set to 0, which means that custom settings are possible.
Since the lower values remain unchanged, programmers can reduce their adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to their desired values and only changing those that do not fit.
Once a setting has been made, each newly adjustable size can be chosen by pressing the "Sub-Test" button.
The default setting appears when pressed unintentionally.
With the "Up" and "Down" buttons,the values can be increased or reduced.
Pressing the "Test" button ends this process.
The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot.
Coin units "credit" displays the number of required units before credit is issued.
"Bonus"-coin units shows.the required units before a bonus credit is issued.
Minimum coins accumulate credits until a specified minimum amount of coins has been reached.
At default,this value (0) does not apply.
CMOS MEMORY (storage)
FAILURE
When "Memory Failure Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed.
All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings.
This condition likely indicates battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method.
Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display).
All LEDs should illuminate and the hardware test can begin.
The tests and settings can be entered into the respective program display, pressing the "Test" switch will display the next program.
If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice to start Video Test in Auto Test mode.
In this program, the device will continuously perform hardware tests until it is turned off.
When the message "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, program plug J 19, 1 2 must be inserted.
With J 19 plug disconnected, memory protection is activated and CMOS RAM Video Test cannot be performed.
Hardware Tests:
These tests are conducted as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM.
If a difference is found, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs.
If the checksum for ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first.
If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced.
The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs.
The E-PROM type for each series is selected by means of a decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732).
Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct.
LED value: 00 0010
If the device holds with the above-mentioned display, an error has been detected.
If the Communications RAMs fail during the Video Board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board.
To locate the error, remove Data Board from P6 and repeat the test.
Failure indicates: errors in U3, U4 or related circuits.
Video Board
CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communication RAM.
If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value.
LED value: 00 0011
If there is an error with the aforementioned display device, check U 85 and U 86 and their associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM.
Verify the correctness of these number sequences when reading them back.
LED value: 00 0100
If this value is displayed, there is an error.
Test U 56, U 57, related multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM).
The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page.
The results of these writings are compared to the original pattern.
Any discrepancy causes the program to halt, and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM.
If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM.
If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test will begin (Data Hardware).
The connection to the data processor must be present, and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics.
That's also the reason for giving it a 1 star rating.
The second reason is that the correct jacket arrived without any visible stitching errors.
BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was even greater.
I had based my decision on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in size L.
Since it's supposed to fit tightly and I didn't want to struggle with an S or M size due to my bust size...
In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips... but I could swim in it everywhere else.
Additionally, when opening the package, some lining material was already coming out and spreading everywhere.
Simply a shame..
It will be returned :/
Fast delivery and good quality workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression.
We were surprised by the good quality.
You can wear it well on both sides.
We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally excited about it.
She usually wears size 158 and the size 36 fits her quite well in this case and will likely also be worn next year.
We can recommend placing an order.
Robust quality I have chosen the rubber pad C because I always work with wood on the jack, which is not optimal.
Unfortunately, I measured wrong and the pad doesn't fit perfectly.
But that's my mistake.
I then made slight adjustments so that it fits.
The pad is very sturdy and no longer damages the edges.
You can use the groove or the entire surface.
It worked without any problems.
Nothing slips anymore.
I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year.
The product itself is okay, but not recommended for children under one year old.
The chewing area is too large for their small mouths.
We got it when our son was 7 months old, but he couldn't use it because of the size.
Now at 12 months old, we found it again and he can use it.
He hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his few existing teeth.
And when it's been in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately, returning it.
I've probably been blinded here by the partly exuberant reviews.
I would like to add that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use.
One very large (for storing equipment) and one fairly small for the most important everyday things that you just take with you.
Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement.
During Prime Day, I purchased this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy with this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand.
When the backpack arrived yesterday, disappointment followed:
The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that's true.
But it cannot compete (as mentioned in many reviews) with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices... guys, that simply isn't true!
I really hoped it would be like that, but there's really no comparison.
The padded walls are much thinner and do not provide such protection as my Lowepro does.
Oh and the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier.
Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro at all.
Even the zippers and materials of the compartments for small items are not particularly high-quality.
Therefore, I have decided to return this backpack.
If I invest in equipment worth thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend money on a decent backpack.
Quality obviously comes at a price here.
For someone who doesn't want to spend much money, this backpack is definitely a good choice; however not for me.
And it's also not like making this decision was difficult for me.
When I unpacked the backpack, after 2 minutes knew it had to go back.
What appealed to me was its color inside; you can definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior.
For someone who has different demands for a backpack, this backpack is probably great, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part So far, I had liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book.
I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part.
In that part, it's all about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time, and I found it unnecessarily dragged out.
Taylor has been crushing on Volt for so long, finally confesses everything, and then acts like a little child and withdraws every time there is an argument?!
At the same time, there were also inconsistencies in my opinion because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince his ex that Taylor couldn't live without him and that he had heard it himself.
But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor.
I had hoped that this would be the final part of the series, but I think this part is the weakest one and also quite unnecessary.
Nevertheless,I will still read the fourth part in hopes that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex.
That would bring more tension back into t Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and do not learn!
First of all:
The movie is not as bad as many write.
Of course, the story is completely contrived and repeatedly conceived according to the same formula.
Once you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends.
And the message is always the same: Humans destroy everything, appreciate nothing, and do not learn!
And that's exactly what this movie wants to tell us!
How often did I think while watching this movie (even though I know it's just a film and the animals are computer-generated):
Oh my God, those poor animals, tears often well up in my eyes.
Therefore Jurassic World:
Fallen
Kingdom is really well made.
It's just a pity that humans simply don't get the message behind this film, even though it's a mainstream movie.
We consistently destroy animals and nature and ultimately our planet along with ourselves out of greed for money and possessions, stupidity, and arrogance!
Empathy for the environment and living beings: absent.
4 stars because the film is well made but unfortunately follows the same principle every time; otherwise it could have been 5 stars.
Nevertheless, well-made popcorn entertainment.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film like 8 Mile here.
This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be one either.
This film is mainly "French" also, it is calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic, and makes one cryif one engages with it and doesn't expect things from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but it doesn't matter.
5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing.
My waistline has grown by 12 cm!
Bloating like never before!
Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day.
Not very helpful, unfortunately despite stopping immediately the diarrhea has been going on for a week now.
It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars were given (unfortunately seen too late), while with the larger one it received full 5 stars?
That is very very strange!
Terrible smell and poor results!
I dyed my blonde hair with an intense toner to a chocolate brown in October, and in February/March, I used this hair color remover.
I applied the product twice.
The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled horrible!
However, the result wasn't too bad it turned out to be a chestnut brown (slightly darker).
Since I didn't achieve my desired result, according to the instructions, I used it again when unsatisfied.
This time was just a waste of time!
It made no difference my hair looked the same as in the first attempt.
And worst of all, weeks after using it, it still stank..
No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended I have been taking the tablets for a long period of time now, one tablet every 5 days.
My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and an additional long-term illness.
I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy nutrition but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2.
This is working very well.
I feel more energetic and much more comfortable.
I sleep better and get out of bed easier.
The price is also great considering how long the tablets can be taken.
Absolutely recommendable.
Function not quite flawless !!!
After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very annoying:
1) Over time, the case has problems connecting to the phone.
This means that it no longer charges even though you have held down the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds.
Removing and reinstalling the phone in the case solves the problem in about 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect.
2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the cover is now so worn out that it comes off from its own accord, which has almost caused me to lose it several times.
Although these are not many major defects, I believe that a battery case should function perfectly in its function, especially considering its cost of €30, and therefore I am very disappointed with this product, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing.
I don't know how all these good reviews come about.
Ultimately, it's actually just an eyeglass cleaning cloth that you can get as a gift in slightly smaller form at any optician.
The cleaning effect is just as good as a kitchen towel and no better.
I expected much more from these cloths, they are also really thin.
Since I used it, I can't exchange it anymore, I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side.
The price for these cloths is way too high; you shouldn't pay more than 2 euros for them.
I doubt the frequency response I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke.
In general, the Onforu works great, it is waterproof (it has already fallen in the shower), it reproduces bass like bass should, Bluetooth works great...
Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come loose...
it can play sound very loudly...
yes.. what I find critical is the frequency response of this little speaker.
As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency.
However, this causes a problem.
Some frequencies are played very loudly while others remain very quiet.
While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt my ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough.
Although my old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, the frequencies were represented quite naturally in terms of volume.
Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu and I find it somewhat annoying.
Therefore, I have to deduct one star for that.
I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
Some places had the paint chipped off and when you touched it with your hand, the paint came off in some places too.
We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense.
They would only replace the damaged parts, but how if both chests of drawers were damaged.
Bad service from the manufacturer, Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money.
A praise to Amazon.
To spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality.
Individual parts are delivered that have to be glued together oneself.
The product was packaged in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard.
There was no additional protection.
Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, some templates were damaged.
I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product.
The included adhesive hardly holds but sticks well like gum that doesn't harden.
Almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick just one day after gluing.
Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), one has to be very careful not to glue everything together.
The templates are partially incomplete or punched out incorrectly.
For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest more money and go for a high-quality product instead.
I am not dissatisfied.
The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even though the instructions are not very clear.
+ Magnetic closures + nice appearance + sturdy when assembled + adjustable shelf position
Doors slamming due to magnets (can possibly be balanced with rubber stoppers) some unclean spots
The supplied dowels are way too small and wobbly (didn't have any others and there was no trophy in the house, so I glued them down with craft glue)
The brackets for the shelf are somewhat wobbly (wrapped them with some paper and leveled it out)
Conclusion:
If it didn't look so good and have good dimensions, I would give it fewer stars because you have to make everything fit to be truly satisfied.
Furthermore, I also find it a bit too expensive for that reason.
I like the coffee... but ...there are only 3 stars.
The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion, the original capsules are better (although also significantly more expensive).
Therefore, I would have given 5 stars.
Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!).
Additionally, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged as seen in the photo) deducts one star for me.
I hope that the manufacturer changes this and soon receives a full score.
It annoys me.
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up.
However, the natural sounds are horrible and incredibly loud.
I couldn't even turn them down.
Probably a defect, supposedly it's possible.
Even the quietest radio setting was too loud for me, I would immediately wake up.
Additionally, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can create shadows on the wall with your hand.
I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning.
But when it finally happened and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me.
I liked the colors and color changes, but unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light.
One good thing was that it has a battery so that in case of a power outage, you don't need to input the time again.
However, it had to be returned due to the reasons mentioned above.
Light great, processing insufficient.
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps.
Unfortunately, I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without sockets instead, a circuit board is smiling at me in this spot...
There was also nothing in the box.
"Pay for 6 receive 4" is not a good deal.
Amazon would probably have handled it generously and quickly, but I only realized this after the return period had expired.
So while I see it as my mistake and live with it, it's still not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs so that's the only reason for deducting two stars.
The light itself is great.
The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated.
The color of the light tends more towards cool white.
Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc.
For living rooms, personally I would prefer warmer light.
Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb indeed
Other lamps can do that too and maybe I will also get intact ones there according to my order should my review be helpful to you;
I appreciate positive ratings!
I try to answer questions quickly.
Great I received the set yesterday and I would like to share my first impressions.
Yes, positive ones.
I debated for a long time whether to order this set or not.
**The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand.
**All utensils have a hole in the handle for hanging them up.
**The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots, and is particularly practical for use with coated pans.
**They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉.
**They also do not conduct heat, so they can be touched directly.
**However, sometimes the dishwasher leaves water spots on the black silicone.
But after a quick wipe, they're gone.
In conclusion, I have to say that I am very surprised and can only recommend them Sold as new, second-hand goods.
Amazon
Prime shipping is simply great.
Delivery within 24 hours.
Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts.
We discovered that the part had already been installed before.
We had to find significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts.
The connections of the hoses were all damaged.
Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately).
Only now did we see that there are also scratch marks/streaks on the chrome-plated faucet itself.
This part was probably already delivered and returned.
We will keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter how it looks there.
Our conclusion; we will never again order such goods through Amazon but rather spend a little more at a hardware store where we get proper quality goods.
It's just sad to see customers being deceived like this!
Product itself top, unfortunately external sensor broken after 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product.
The installation was very easy, and the range is also very good.
There are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside.
I also find the design of the device appealing.
It is very simple and can be either wall-mounted or set up like a small picture frame.
The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, it seems that the device that measures the values outside is broken.
However, the thermometer still seems to be intact as plausible values continue to be displayed here.
On the other hand, it appears that the hygrometer is broken because it consistently shows completely astronomical values for outdoor air humidity.
That's a shame since the device was mounted in a protected location outside and it's also why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak grass catcher
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still happily driving around the country with Hermes today, without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always.
The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression.
The motor is powerful and it provides a nice cutting result.
The noise level is not particularly impressive low, but okay.
A major drawback, unfortunately, is the collection bag.
Firstly, it is made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between.
When you set it down full for just a moment, it naturally gets compressed and parts of its contents fall out.
However, worse still is that the actually practical fill level indicator turns red when the bag is only half full.
That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large portions of its clippings from that point onward.
Emptying the bag when it's only half full cannot be considered a solution for large lawn areas.
Therefore, I cleaned up the device as best I could and returned it.
Conclusion:
In principle, a very good mower that becomes unusable for me due to an unfortunate construction of its collection bag.
Good device for monitoring.
I have two of these devices.
The device can be easily integrated via the app.
The included plug-in sensor cable is very good and can be extended if necessary.
The device is solidly built.
Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app.
For the following reasons I am only giving 4 stars:
The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is difficult to close again.
One of the two devices is in a room with thick walls.
This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks.
Unfortunately, it does not reconnect automatically even if you place it near the router.
You have to remove the batteries and then reinsert them after a short pause, then it reconnects.
It should actually work without removing the batteries.
There is always an alarm when connection is lost.
The alarm tone could be a bit louder."
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to properly level the hotbed yet.
The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw is practically falling out because it's not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low.
The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table.
Maybe someone knows what can be done about it because it's impossible to print anything like this.
Regarding assembly:
The assembly was relatively problem-free; they could just show how to route the cables because otherwise you have to reroute them multiple times, which is very tiring.
I have already contacted support but haven't received a response even after a week of waiting.
Unfortunately, returning it is no longer an option.
I was expecting more than this.
Robust and precise I am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed.
This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements.
It comes with two batteries, so you can start right away.
The packaging of the caliper is simple, but it fulfills its purpose completely.
Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods.
I can only give it full marks and believe that it will last at least as long as the old caliper.
From me, there is a clear recommendation to buy, as a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor.
Bought the bracelet and so far haven't worn it because it emits a disgusting smell.
Until today, this smell hasn't gone away, even though it has been constantly "aired out".
Since returning is no longer possible, I have disposed of it.
I advise against buying it.
For the price okay.
The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too big for me, making it look quite bulky.
The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice.
However, the overall processing of the chain is very simple, so I have already broken the clasp twice.
So far, I have been able to repair it again every time, but I don't think that will last long.
But for the cheap price, you can't expect anything really high quality anyway.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds!
You just have to pull the end through its mouth, it can't come undone, amazing!
I rubbed it with some leather care, making it even softer and more flexible.
Just one thing: if you have something magnetic on your arm:
The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately garbage!
I was already disappointed after unpacking because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods.
The base station was fine.
Now to the function:
Only connects after some tinkering....
if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it did the transmitters finally connect.
Unfortunately, my joy about this didn't last long because after an hour, the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station.
The display of the three transmitters was also very different!
All in all, not usable for me like this!
The thing has been returned!
I would definitely advise against buying it as it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I already had this garden pump once, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted off.
I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit.
I hope that the previous pump had a manufacturing defect with its shaft and that this current pump will last a little longer in service.
Unfortunately, the new pump had transportation damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken.
The cardboard box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend better packaging for future pumps instead of just using thin cardboard.
Nevertheless, I kept the pump since as described above, I urgently needed it and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect its pumping performance.
Could have been thought through better.
Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought an organizer would be more convenient than carrying around a huge keyring all the time.
At first, everything went well.
However, the paint quickly started to come off and the screws had to be tightened constantly.
It's nice that you can do that with a penny coin, but only with a penny coin.
I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't immediately ruin the entire screw.
Now, let's get to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys.
It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths with the various parts, but once you have screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it apart again.
Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience and balance and dexterity.
Ultimately, on my third attempt at assembling it, the screw broke in its thread and rendered the entire thing useless.
Conclusion:
If at all possible, only use it once for all necessary keys and then never again; but at this price point, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions Smooth-running zippers, the material looks sturdy and all that in featherweight.
Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use.
In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than stated.
At the moment, I still can't really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week vacation.
If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase as before.
It should be noted that not 8 but 10 pieces were delivered because two smaller pouches were included in the round cosmetic bag.
Not processed high quality, but wanted to mention it nonetheless.
The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally.
The price-performance ratio appears to me as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
Also, ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas as well.
Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't work anymore.
Battery?
Replaced.
But it still doesn't work.
So I could have just thrown the money into the trash can directly.
Care is always good!
The application is simple, but you should approach the brush very carefully so as not to damage the needle.
I couldn't hear an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected.
Two black cables were included.
The battery life lasts very long.
Definitely sufficient sound quality.
I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable.
The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear.
The weight is also kept very low.
Recommendation for purchase in this price range.
Chic dress
Very beautiful dress, which is suitable for a variety of occasions.
The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale.
It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as recommended).
I just wished the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have as slim upper arms as the model in the picture).
But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off.
It can't get any worse.
I really and seriously didn't expect such garbage to be sold nowadays.
The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop.
It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power.
Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible.
DVDs usually work, but Blu-rays are detected very unreliably at best.
The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes noises like those you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives.
After minutes, you can either restart your computer because nothing happens anymore or the disc is finally recognized.
But in that case, you must absolutely not press pause or skip to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything at all.
This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze.
In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included with it.
If you buy PowerDVD or something similar additionally for a fee, then this drive's price doubles.
It does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty.
First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually a sham, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port.
The other plug is just for charging devices and therefore relatively useless.
I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed.
I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I definitely wouldn't have bought this clumsy lump with golden plugs.
But apart from the appearance and my misjudgment, the extension cord fulfills its purpose very reliably.
And thanks to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB stick doesn't just dangle around like with a normal extension cord.
So not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is limited :-).
Small but powerful!
I bought this product so that I can have an audio output and connect a display to my iPad (Pro).
With iOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth.
This works very well.
Furthermore, the audio output was as expected.
Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to return could not do this.
The HDMI output is practical.
I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via Bluetooth and the HDMI connected to the TV.
Charging at the same time is not a problem.
Sound is delivered through HDMI.
What else do I need my PlayStation for? :P
There was a small adapter included that can be attached to the tablet.
This should provide stability and also has magnetic mounting.
It doesn't fit with my case, but it holds securely anyway and has contact, so...
All in all, it's somewhat expensive but justified by its full range of functions.
It's also very small and made of solid aluminum in one piece.
Price-performance ratio is great Lots of power Top device.
Has been running smoothly for months.
It's not exactly lightweight or quiet but it delivers good performance.
I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) rather cool and therefore I always use level 2.
It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well.
And I also like the simple design.
Competing products often look like spaceships
Very good.
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, even though the price difference compared to the original is very big, but does not give a cheap impression.
In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed.
Overall, I found these brushes to be very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised.
In live mode, the tracking is accurate to about 0.5 meters.
In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it sometimes jumps a few meters, but this is not bothersome.
I would buy it again anytime.
However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer.
Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days.
A solution that could last 7-14 days would be ideal.
There is an XL version available but unfortunately it is too big for our taste; we wouldn't need the battery to last that long anyway and changing it daily is impractical in our opinion.
One should engage with the dog, not with its collar :-)
The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, garbage.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes.
They fit well and also seem to be comfortable.
However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more.
Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole already breaks after a few weeks and the shoes cannot be used anymore.
With the last pair, it was also the case that they didn't last very long in regular use, but I thought it would be enough for class.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.
The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly but original?
Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones.
These ones, however, seem poorly made at first glance.
They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before.
At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any noticeable difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap at the heel sits quite loosely and will most likely not hold up for five years like my previous ones did.
I'm curious!
Surprisingly good.
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical.
However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in my car, I decided to take a chance and ordered it.
The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump.
About the mattress:
I tried it out in my car (Citroen Berlingo).
I noticed that there was some mold on one side.
I wiped it off and hope it doesn't reappear.
Once inflated, a test lying down was immediately conducted.
It's comfortable to lie on and perfect for the festival.
Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but for days at the event it's pure luxury.
The mattress fits perfectly in my car.
We removed the rear seats beforehand, so it fits perfectly.
About the air pump:
The air pump has various adapters.
The mattress requires two different adapters which can be found on the pump itself.nevertheless,the plug was defective (a problem with the solder joint).
Since my friend is skilled at handiwork, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, that good part worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time at all.
I'm very impressed with the mattress overall.
I'm curious about how well it will hold up during the festival.
I hope that it doesn't lose any air and lasts long.
And also that mold doesn't reappear.
After testing,I can definitely recommend it.
For future experiences,I will revise this review accordingly(if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€...
Unfortunately, I can only give the calendar two stars. :( 1.
For the fast shipping.
2.
For the idea of the toy.
Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open on several doors already on day 1 due to poor processing.
There were no doors left on door number 21 and I had to allow my son to remove the remaining parts because they were practically falling out already.
The pieces often come out mixed up, which means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach them properly.
After assembling the car completely, parts fall off during play (especially the windshield).
It is also very difficult to reattach it.
Overall, I wouldn't buy this calendar again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.
Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider how they design the calendar for future editions and make improvements.\ a real drone I am enthusiastic about the drone.
My 7-year-old daughter flies it.
Indoors, it flies very well and the 5-minute flight time is usually sufficient.
I didn't expect anything different at this price that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem.
Nice contact for any questions.
Game okay but only playable with mandatory Steam.
Didn't realize when purchasing that it's not a game CD but just a code to download the game.
That would be fine so far, but one is forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous.
Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which wouldn't happen with a simple installation of the game for sure.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime.
I was really looking forward to the watch.
Design and appearance are great, messages etc.
Were displayed without any problems.
Operation worked well.... and yet I'm sending it back.
The big drawback: the battery and its runtime.
Charged in the evening, just lying on the shelf overnight, and in the morning 11% less battery with no usage.
If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery would already be empty by noon / early afternoon, and then you can't even tell the time anymore.
Therefore not usable for me.
Very unfortunate.
Noble case with restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it is definitely advisable to get a case.
Recently, I have liked cases into which you can also insert your credit card.
This case here offers that.
If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much and the cover stands a bit high.
One is enough for me.
The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well-made.
It looks classy.
Unlike many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, with only cutouts at the connectors.
Otherwise, you can easily operate the power button and volume controls on the sides through the cover.
The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case.
Even on TORRO's leather QI charging station, it doesn't work either.
Accessories like Galaxy Buds can only be charged when the case is off as well.
Otherwise, really chic and well-made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film Robust case with a genuine tempered glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11.
Fits very well and can be easily put on.
The material is pleasant to hold and does not get dirty.
A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio.
This case gives the phone some grip.
It is not too bulky and fits securely on the phone.
Overall, a good purchase.
